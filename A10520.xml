            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN SCIPIO BEHELDE OVTE of the high heauens the smallenes of the earth with the kingdomes in it, he coulde no lesse but esteeme the trauaile of men moste vaine, which sustaine so muche grief with infinite daungers to get so small a corner of that lyttle balle. so that it yrked him (as he then declared) to considre the smalnes of that their kingdom, whiche men so muche did magnifie. Who soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer therefore (by Scipions good admonishment) doth minde to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the name of vanitie, and wishe to attayne the name of a man, lette him contemne those trifelinge triumphes, and little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme that little lumpe of claye: but rather looke vpwarde to the heauens, as nature hath taught him, and not like a beaste go po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe on the grounde, and lyke a scathen swine runne rootinge in the earthe. Yea let him think (as Plato with diuers other philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers dyd trulye affirme) that for this intent were eies geuen vnto men, that they might with them beholde the heauens: whiche is the theatre of Goddes mightye power, and the chiefe spectakle of al his diuine workes. There are those visible creatures of God, by which many wise philosophers attained to the knowledg of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible power. There are those straunge constellations, by whiche Job doth prooue the mightye Maiestie and omnipotency of God. There are those pure creatures, whiche waxe not werye with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, nother growe olde by continuance, but are as freshe nowe in beutye and shape, as the firste daye of their creation. and as apte nowe to perfourme their course, as they were the firste hower that
<pb facs="tcp:16115:5"/> they began. And thoughe time wholly depend of it, yet time can not vtter anye force in it▪ yea thoughe all other thinges in the worlde by tyme be consumed, and euen the moste harde metals freted into drosse, yet the liquide heauens not only gouerne time it selfe, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly stande cleere from all corruption of time. Oh woorthy temple of Goddes magnificence: Oh throne of glorye and seate of the lorde: thy substaunce most pure what tonge can describe? thy beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with starres so garnished and glytteringe: thy motions so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous, thine influence strange, thy tokens so terrible, to stonishe mennes hartes. thy signes are so wonderous, surmountinge mannes witte, the effects of thy motions so diuers in kinde: so harde for to searche, and worse for to fynde. Thy greatnes so huge, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe so large, thy rollyng so swifte, and yet seemeth slowe: thy staye so vnknowen, thy place without name: thy spheres are mere wondres, and so is thy frame. Thy lyghtes are so lykinge to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte mennes myndes, no beaste is so brutishe, but that hee styll fyndes, thy warmenes to woorke him greate solace and ease: thy coloure to comforte his sight and his braine. Thy starres in suche ordre, thy circles so fine: thy platte forme is painted with manye a signe. Oh meruailous maker, oh God of good gouernaunce: thy woorkes are all wonderous, thy cunning vnknowen: yet seedes of all knowledge in that booke are sowen. The signes of the tymes who can them comprise? the tokens of troubles what man could de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uise? And yet in that boke who rightly can reade, to all secrete knowledge it will him straighte leade. The starre in the easte dyd gouerne the Wisemen, and taughte them the very region where Christe should be borne. And farther by it they vnderstode, that he was the true kynge of Jewes, and sauiour of Jsraell. And thoughe manye sawe the starre as well as they, yet fewe or none knewe the signification but they yet dyd God at the beginning or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the starres to be as signes and tokens of times alteration: and namely of suche straunge effectes as seldome come in vre, and therefore are knowen but to fewe men. These woorkes the more
<pb facs="tcp:16115:5"/> strange they be, the more oughte men to esteeme the frute of them: to magnifie the knowledge of them, and to studye to vnderstande the mean to attaine them, but most of all to honour, praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the author of them. who willeth nothinge to happen so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on the moste wicked, but by som signes and tokens hee giueth warnyng of them. of which thing who so euer standeth in doubt, let him pervse the state of tymes, and hee shall see wonderouse thinges. Before the floude of Noe althoughe God did by speciall reuelation vtter his mynde to his seruaunte Noe, yet dyd hee also by wondrefull signes and straunge coniunctions, expresse the same to the whole world. for all the Planetes were in coniunction in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terye Signes. so that no nation might excuse them selues, for that they were so farre distaunte from Noe, that they could not heare his preachinge. sith all nations myght see the heauens and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens in it, althoughe but fewe in euery nation coulde skyll of them. And thoughe Noe coulde not in person go into all partes of the worlde, yet was that office supplied by the heauens, of whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolutions it is written by Dauid the prophet: They haue no speach nor language, so that their voice can not bee hearde. yet did their course extende into all the earthe, and their woordes into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame boundes of the worlde. So was there neuer anye greate chaunge in the worlde, nother translations of Imperies, nother scarse anye falle of famous princes, no dearthe and penurye, no death and mortalitie, but GOD by the signes of heauen did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishe men therof, to repent and beware betyme, if they had any grace. The examples ar infinite, and all histories so full of them, that J thinke it needeles to make any rehersall of them now: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeyng thei appertain to the Iudicial part of Astronomy, rather then to this parte of the motions, yet shall it not bee preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall anye waies, to repeate an example or twoe. As namelye before the buildinge of Rome, there was a verye notable eclipse of the Sonne, declaringe that the libertye of the worlde beganne then to decay, whē Rome began to rise: which shuld subdue all the
<pb facs="tcp:16115:6"/> world neare hand: as in effect afterwarde it dyd succeede, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe styll by lytle and little, and continuynge for a longe tyme, tyll the Gothes in the time of Arcadius and Honorius, did spoile that citye, and subdue their power. At which time also straunge signes dyd appeare in the ayer, and in the skye: whiche seemed not onlye to signifie the deuastation of the Imperye of Rome, but also the subduyng of all the weste prouinces, by straunge inuasion of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations. Many other straunge eclipses both of Sonne and Moone, beside the appearing of sondrye Sonnes, and straunge shapes of the Moone, and the starres diuerselye disordered, with Rainbowes of meruailous formes, Cometes of diuers kindes, and other wonderfull signes, whiche euer were messangers of as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effectes, of newe innouations, straunge transmutations, and sometime vtter subuersions, not onlye of small prouinces, but also of greate kingdomes, yea and of many regions at ones. And therefore sayth M. Manilius.</p>
            <q>Nunquam futilibus excanduit ignibus aether.</q>
            <q>
               <l>The earthe doth euer feele griefe and teene,</l>
               <l>When those straunge syghtes in heauen be seene.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But who that can skyll of their natures, and coniecture rightlye the effect of them and their menacynges, shall be able not only to auoide many inconueniences, but also to atchiue many vnlikelye at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes: and in conclusion be a gouernoure and rulare of the stars accordynge to that vulgare sentence gathered of Ptolemye:</p>
            <q>Sapiens dominabitur astris.</q>
            <q>
               <l>The wise by prudence, and good skyll,</l>
               <l>Maye rule the starres to serue his will.</l>
            </q>
            <p>J mynde not to discourse in declaringe the profite and commodity of Astronomye, but only to admonishe briefly the reader, that hee maye thinke the study woorthye his trauaile, and to knowe it to be the moste necessary studye that can be, for anye man that desireth perfection of wisedome. What benefite doth come by it to the true knowledge of husbandrye and nauigation, J am assured the verye simplest in those artes do partlye perceaue: and the cunningest
<pb facs="tcp:16115:6"/> in the same do so fullye vnderstande, that they iudge them selues naked and bare without it, and vtterlye destitute of all excellency in their arte. Jn physicke the vse of it is so large in iudginge due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of complexions, in prescribinge righte ordre of diete and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, in gouernaunce of healthe, for iuste ministration of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in time of sickenes, and in righte iudgement of the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call daies, that without it physicke is to be accompted vtterlye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte. For proofe wherof althoughe there be infinite places in Hippocrates and Galene, and diuers other good writers, yet hee that hathe readde in Hippocrates but that one booke of Ayer, water, and Regions, and Galen his third boke of Criticall daies, can not be ignoraunte howe necessarye an instrument Astronomy is vnto Physicke, as bothe those bookes do testifie at large. But omittinge the testimonies of famous wryters (whiche would make a wonderfull volume of them selues, if they were written only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) J wyll vse a simple plaine proofe manifest to all men, and therefore moste apte for to perswade all men. Firste to begin with sowinge of graine, with graffynge and plantinge, who is so rude, but knoweth that without these be dulye doone, and in their seasonable time, men can not conueniently lyue on the earthe? And bowe are their times knowen, but by the risinge and setting of cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine notable starres? Peraduenture some man will answere, that by the monethes of the yeare all men do know their times without farther Astronomy whiche answere is suche, as if a carpentar or mason shoulde saye, that he can woorke with his compasse, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, squire, plumbe rule, and suche like instrumentes, without any knowledg in Geometrye. but how ridiculous an answer this were, all men can iudge. Likewaies, if a master of a shippe would say, that he can saile and gouerne his course by his compasse and his carde, with his quadrante and his other instrumentes, without any knowledge in Cosmographye or Astronomye, would not all men that heare him, deryde him, or thinke him madde, for speaking so vndiscreatly, especially such as know (as few ar ignorant therin)
<pb facs="tcp:16115:7"/> that all those instrumentes are made by those artes, and appertain to them? So if the distinction of times do depende of Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my all togither, and the monethes woulde soone runne out of their courses, if the ayde that it hathe by that arte were neglected, so that Michelmas day wold happen in the Spring time, and the An nunciation of our Ladye would fall after haruest (as the truthe is, it would do, if Astronomicall accompte were not) who can shew him selfe so madde as to denye the necessarye vse of Astronomye, in due keping the times of the yeares? The ecclesiasticall historye dothe declare at large, and other writers in greate numbre do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, that greate controuersye hath beene in the churche, for the righte obseruation of Easter, whiche controuersye could neuer be decided but by the knowledge of Astronomye. And of late yeares in diuers councelles redresse hath beene sought for the iuste obseruation of it: consideringe that if errour be in it, all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable feastes, are wrongly kepte by that occasion, and Lente dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed so, that some tyme it hath beene kepte sooner then it ought, and at other times later then it oughte. whiche faulte can neuer bee redressed but by astronomy. Whereby it appeareth also manifestly, that in ecclesiasticall maters Astronomy hath a great vse. but that is so well knowen, that euerye man almoste doth confesse it. And generally who so euer dothe take benefite by the dewe distinction of the yeare, he can not chose but acknowledge that the same com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie doth come by Astronomy. Jf J should specially and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticularlye discourse in euerye kinde of science and artes, and shewe how they are ayded by astronomye, J should make my preface ouer longe, and repeate thinges that all men doth knowe. Jn lawe for contractes and bargaines the time is moste necessarye to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but especiallye if they depende of moueable feastes, wherein astronomy must discusse the doubte. Jn Grammar, Logike and Rhetorike howe needefull it is, and in histories also, J neede say nothinge, but remitte all men to the readinge of those bokes, which are vsed in those artes, whereby it shall appeare, that without the
<pb facs="tcp:16115:7"/> principles of Astronomye those bookes can not bee vnderstande. Then for vulgare artes how the knowledge of ebbes and studdes doth profite, manye men, but speciallye mariners can testifie: and namely suche as vnderstande, what errour commeth by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the true accompte therein and the vulgare accompte. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for loppinge of trees and wodde fall, and diuers other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations in husbandry, the consideration of the sonne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye of the moone doth greatly healpe. Wherfore J maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in all artes and sciences, in lawe, physicke and diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in mariners arte and husbandrye, the profite of Astronomye is exceding necessarye. But aboue all other thinges the testimonye of Christe in the scripture doth most approue it, when he doothe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that signes of his comming, and of other straunge effectes shall be seene in the Sonne, Moone and Starres. Also for alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of wether he testified that many did marke the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and pronounced truly of the wether, and therefore blameth them that thei coulde not marke and iudge the signes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Sonne of man. But here possiblye some men will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte the saynge of the prophete: Feare not the signes of heauen-wherevnto J maye duelye answere: that those woordes of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remye do forbidde honouringe of them as goddes, as the texte is plaine. for oftentimes in the scriptures fear of God is taken for honoure of God, and so is it here, els other wayes might J answer that the true seruantes of God whiche haue reposed the loue and feare of God in their heartes, are neuer aferde of any tokens that God sendeth, but reioyce to see them, and glorifie God for them. But bicause in this case there be manye diuines that can better de clare those thinges then J, whiche am a man of an other professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, J will remitte that matter to them. only admonishing all men, that the Sonne, the Moone and the Starres, were ordained of God to serue all nations that be vnder the heauens, as Moses dooth testifie. Then seynge God hath made them for mannes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie, and to be distincters of times, and for signes and tokens,
<pb facs="tcp:16115:8"/> for aide of mennes knowledge, let not men be vnkinde to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but lyfte vp their eies to heauen and beholde the good guiftes of God: Note diligently their meruailous motions, and studiouslye considre their wondrefull alterations, with perpetualle constancye and inuiolable ordre: so shall men neuer bee doubtfull of Goddes prouidence towarde them, of his daylye prouision for them, when they see that he hath made suche an vnexplicable frame to serue onlye for mannes vse, for whose sake all other creatures also were made. Jn token therfore of thankfulnes, let vs singe an Hymne vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to that God, praisinge his name, and magnifiynge him foreuer and euer.</p>

Nowe for the forme and shape of them, you shall vnderstande, that the whole worlde is rounde exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as anye ball or globe,<note place="margin">The forme of the world and his partes.</note> and so are all the principall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of it, euerye sphere seuerallye and ioyntlye, as well of the Planetes, as of the Fixed starres, and so are all the foure Elementes.

               <p>This I do well vnderstande in wordes, and the easier by this picture, whiche I finde in euerie booke of the Sphere, but that I see there more spheres, then you speake of: for in some bookes mention is made of nyne spheres: and in other are ten spheres named, where you sette foorthe but eighte.</p>

               <p>The cause of this diuersitie will I in the fourthe treatise declare: in the meane season, I thinke it best to tell you of no mo spheres, then are perceptible by sighte, for so manye are we certaine of. And therefore vnderstande you thus, that as the eihhte sphere is the greatest, and hath none other without him that maye be seene, so the earthe is the leaste,<note place="margin">The earthe is the cētre of the worlde.</note> and hathe none other within hym, but it standeth in the middle and in the centre of the whole worlde, and of euery one of these spheres, and therfore it is called the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the worlde: so that although the earthe in it selfe haue a greate and notable quantity,<note place="margin">The earthe hath no quantity in respecte to the world.</note> yet in comparison to the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, it is to bee esteemed but as a centre or little pricke, yea in deed muche lesse than any notable starre that you see, <hi>&amp;</hi> if I shall speak boldly that which I intend herafter to proue certainly, the earthe is lesser then the leaste starre in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament whiche is commonly seen, but yet is it greater thē Venus or Mercury, yea greater then the Moone.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>This affirmation seemeth to me impossible, or at the least contrary to sence: for the Mone seemeth bygger muche then any starre, yea somwhat bigger then the Sonne.</p>

               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Content your selfe to credite me, tyll tyme serue for the proof of my woordes, and in the meane season, to procede as I began. You must thinke, that the earth and the water annexed togither in one globe, are of no notable quantitye, in comparison to the firmament, and that it stan deth as the centre of the worlde,<note place="margin">The earthe hath no motion.</note> and hath no motion out of his place, nother yet circular mouyng about his owne cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, but resteth (as we may say) quiete without all such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16115:14"/> Lyke wayes must you thinke of the other elementes, whiche of their owne nature haue none other motion then a stone or a lyghte fether, so that they may be accompted all four to be without naturall motion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>Yet in the water and in the ayer we see euerye day notable mouynge. and sometime I haue hearde of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge of the earthe, by earthquakes: and as for the fyer that we see, it alwaies moueth and fly ckereth in burninge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>And so you haue seene a stone moue swiftelye, when it fell from anye hyghe place. but these motions haue an ende quicklye, excepte they be continued with violence, as hereafter I will sufficientlye declare. But as the stone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it wyll moue in fallinge, yet in his place lyeth quiete without motion: so the earthe of it selfe, and the other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes muste be accompted quyete by nature, and without motion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heauens.</note>¶ The heauens contrarye wayes haue suche a naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that neuer resteth nyghte nor daye, nother can be staied by any violence. This motion wee se in the heauens daylye by their mouinge from the easte to the weste, and from the weste to the easte againe, aboute the earthe, ones euerye 24. howers, and therfore is thys motion named the Daily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it is the measure of a Naturall day,<note place="margin">A <hi>Daye.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Yet one doubte I haue, of whiche I wolde glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be rydde, and that is of the Moone: for as you saye, and by syghte wee perceaue, all the starres with the Sonne and Moone go round about the earth in 24. houres,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> diuers motion in the Mone.</note> saue that the Moone is slacker then all the rest, for she is euerye daye later in rysynge by an hower, then she was the daye before: but howe that cometh to passe, I doo not vnderstande.</p>

               <p>This doubt is well moued, and in good tyme, for by it will I take occasion to instruct you not only in the true knowledge of it, but also of other sondrye motions in all the heauens: for in euery one of them dooth there appeare a lyke motion, contrarye to the dailye mouinge of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, whiche in the Moone is moste swiftest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be perceaued daylye of all men: but in the Sonne it is not so swifte, and therfore not so easilye perceaued: yet all men see a greate alteration in the mouynge of the Sonne in one yeare:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> scuerall mouing in the Sonne.</note> for somtimes he is hygher and nearer ouer our headdes, and sometime farther from our headdes, and lower in the southe: yea sometime he shineth with vs almoste 18. howers, (as in the middle of the Sommer) and in the middle of Winter hee shineth but 6. houres or lyttle more: this euerye childe dooth see, althoughe they knowe not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>Yet the reason of that is easy inough to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, for when the daye is at the longest, the Sonne muste needes shine the more tyme, and so must it needes shine the lesser tyme, when the day is at the shortest: this reason I haue hearde many men declare.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>That may well be called a crabbed reason, for it goeth backward lyke a crabbe. The day maketh not the son
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16115:15"/> to shyne, but the Sonne shynynge maketh the daye. And so the lengthe of the daye maketh not the Sonne to shine longe, nother the shortenes of the day causeth not the Son to shyne the lesser tyme, but contrarye waies the longe shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the Sonne maketh the longe daye, and the shorte shyning of the sonne maketh the lesser daye: els answere me, what maketh the dayes longe or shorte?</p>

               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>I perceaue it nowe, but I was so blynded with the volgare erroure, that if you hadde demaunded of me farther what dydde make the Sommer, I hadde beene lyke to haue aunswered, that greene leaues doo make Sommer: and the sooner by remembraunce of an olde sayinge: that a yeare shoulde come, in whiche the Sommer shoulde not bee knowen, but by the greene leaues.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That is it that draue wise menne to searche, and

               <p>They are named after the coaste of the worlde
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16115:22"/> where they bee. So that the circle whiche incloseth all those starres that be about the Northe pole, is named the Arctyke circle or Northe circle: and the contrary circle in the south, is called the Antartike circle by the greeke composition, as you woulde say, Contrary or against the Arctike circle: and it may well be called the South circle. But nowe heare howe Proclus defineth them.</p>

               <p>So it is: And thys circle thus drawen in the middle betwene bothe the Poles, is the Equinoctiall cyrcle in that sphere. Now to make the two Tropiks,<note place="margin">To drawe the twoo Tropikes.</note> open your compas so▪ that they maye extend to 66. degrees and an halfe of the said Equinoctiall cyrcle. and then set one foot of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe in which Pole you will, and with the other foot draw a circle on the Globe, which shal stand for one of the tropiks, and setting the foote of the same compasse vnaltered, in the other Pole, draw about it an other circle, for the other tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyke. Now appointe names for the Poles,<note place="margin">The Poles.</note> callyinge one the South pole or Antartike pole, and the other the North pole or Arctik pole: and then the tropikes of necessity will take their names: for that Tropike which is next the North Pole, must be the tropike of Cancer, that is,<note place="margin">The Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes.</note> the Sōmer tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike, and the other that is nexte to the Southe Pole, must needes bee the Tropyke of Capricorne, or the Wynter Tropyke.

And if you haue doone well, then procede to the making of the Zodiake, whiche you shall draw thus. Open your compasse to the same wydenesse that you dydde for makyng the Colures, or the equinoctiall, <hi>&amp;</hi> then recken from one of the poles (whiche you will) 23 degrees and an halfe, in any one of the Colures,<note place="margin">Pole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">

(as you confessed before) then with a lesser cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe (for it shall bee meete that you haue diuers sorts) draw a circle of that circuit abouteche Pole, setting the fixed foot of the compas in the Pole, and stretching the other soot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 66 degrees <hi>&amp;</hi> a half. After this looke whether these circles do cut lyke degrees in euery quarter of the Colures: and if it do, your woorke is righte, els it must be redressed. These circles maye well bee called Pole circles, or Polar cyrcles. Then take your greater compasse opened (as is before declared) to the wydenesse of a quarter of the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,<note place="margin">The dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of the zodiak</note> and sette one foote of them in that poyncte where the Polare circle that is aboute the Northe pole, dooth crosse the tropyke Colure in that quarter, whyche goeth from that same Pole, to the. 270. degree of the Equinoctiall, and holdynge that foote steddye, with the other drawe a circle aboute the Globe.<note place="margin">Proof.</note> This circle will touche the twoo Tropikes in twoo of those places, where they crosse the Tropike Colures: and also it wyll crosse the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall in twoo pointes, that is, in hys very begynnynge, and in the ende of the 180. degree. Nowe to proue whether it be truely drawen or not, by an other meanes,<note place="margin">An other proof.</note> set one foote of that compasse (with whiche yow drew the Zodiake) in that pointe whiche is directly contrarye to the firste place, where you stayed hit: that is to faye, in the crossynge of the fouthe Polare circle, and that quarter of the tropike Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, whiche goeth from the South pole to the 90. degree of

But considering that the Zodiake (as you hearde before) hath in it twelue degres of bredthe, that is, on eche syde of the Ecliptike lyne sixe, therefore open your compasse to 84. degrees only, that is sixe degrees lesse then a quarter of the Equinoctiall, and set one foote of it fixedly in the one Pole of the Zodiake, and with the other moueable foote drawe a circle, whiche wyll be a Parallele to the Ecliptike circle, distaunte from it in all partes by 6 degrees, and with the same compasse vnaltered, draw a lyke circle on the other Pole of the Zodiake, whiche shall bee a Parallele to the other twoo, and they three do make the full Zodiake in length and breadth.</p>

               <p>I dyd of purpose omytte them before, bicause they ar named of diuers men, as of Ioannes de Sacro Bosco and other later writers, for the circles Arctike and Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike, contrarye to Proclus, and all the greeke writers, and I pourposed (and so doo I still) to reserue the discussing of that repugnance, to the fourthe treatise, yet here was suche iuste occasion ministred to vse their helpe in fyndynge the poles of the Zodiake, by whiche poles they are described euery day, by the reuolution of the heauens, that I coulde not willyngly neglecte them: for although I myghte fynde the poles of the Zodiake without them, yet they bringe a proof of the woorke with them, as before I haue shewed, and also they enclose all suche starres as are within 23. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16115:30"/> and a halfe of the Pole, and are the lymites of the motion that the Poles of the Zodiake doo make about the poles of the worlde, as you shall better perceaue hereafter. And bycause their names shoulde not bee confounded with the circles, Arctike and Antarctike, I thinke it moste meete to cal them only Polare circles, or Pole circles, which name the other circles may not iustly chalenge, especially bycause they are not fixed (as the Pole circles are) but be chaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the regions chaunge. which thing I will declare more largely hereafter, but nowe for the drawinge of the circles Arctike <hi>&amp;</hi> Antarctike, that is (as I named them) the Northe circle, and the Southe circle,<note place="margin">Circles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike and Antarctik.</note> you muste learne the eleuation of the region for whiche the Globe is made, and according to it must you draw those circles, whiche thinge bicause as yet it is not easye for you to doo, I will in example of oure owne cuntrye shew their description, namely for the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitye of Cambridge, whiche standeth in euen degrees of 52. Therfore recken from one of the Poles 52. degrees in anye Colure, and it will lyghte on 38. degrees (bicause the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres go backward) and there set one foote of your compas, extending the other foote to the next Pole, where you shall staye it, and with the other foote describe a circle fyrst about the one Pole, and then about the other: and those two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles shall stand for our circles Arctike <hi>&amp;</hi> Antarctike. And thus hath the Globe all those circles whiche were accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted needfull vnto it, excepte the Horizonte and the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diane circle, whiche are not so well placed in the Globe as without it, bicause they ought not to moue with the Globe.</p>

Then
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16115:31"/> consider that the Zodiake is all ready diuided into foure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall quarters by the two Colures, now it is meet to diuide euerye quarter into three equall partes, and so haue you twelue partes in the whole Zodiake, whiche stande for the twelue Signes, which shall be distinct by lynes drawen ouer thwarte all the breadth of the Zodiake.</p>

When you haue drawen these twelue signes, thē must you diuide euery one of them fyrste into two parts equally, and eche of them againe into three euen partes, and lastlye, euery one of them into fiue iuste portions, and so haue you in euery Signe, thirtye partes or degrees.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16115:33"/> When you haue drawen this circle on bothe those bordes, on the same centre make an other circle in eche bord, a corn bredth wider then that other: and after that an other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wider, as you may ayme two corne bredthes: and then the fourth wider then the thyrde by a quarter of an ynche: and yet againe one other a quarter of an ynche wyder then the fourth. and these fiue circles shall you make in bothe the bordes, and you shall diuide them bothe in one manner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this sorte.</p>
               <p>Diuide the innermost circle saue one, into 4. quarters first, and after that, euerye quarter into three partes, and eche of those partes into 30. as you dyd before in dyuers cyrcles of the Globe. then set your ruler to the centre, and to euery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision,

            <p>The thirde is the draughte of the Zodiake with his iuste bredth of sixe degrees, and the twelue Signes sett forth with their degrees ordrely. And these three circles be all of one lengthe.</p>
            <p>The fourth circle dothe represent the due lengthe of the two Tropikes, whiche must be shorter then the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by 30 degrees, for it is equall to 330 partes of the same: so that the lengthe of the Tropike dothe beare the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Equinoctiall, as 11 doth to 12.</p>
            <p>The fyfte plate, resembleth the measure of the circles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike and Antarctike, and is in lengthe equall with 222. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Equinoctiall, which proportion is as 37. to 60.</p>
            <p>The sixte plate setteth forth the iuste measure of the twoo Pole circles, whiche is equall to 144. degrees of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and so it beareth to him the same proportion that 2. dothe beare to 5. and eche of those circles Paralleles are diuided lyke vnto the Equinoctiall, into their 360. degrees.</p>

               <p>You say well, for in deed there is no suche motion in heauen, that maye make the Pole so notably to chaunge his place: but as we doo chaunge our standinge, so dooth there appear a newe Horizonte, whiche causeth the Pole to seeme higher. if we go towarde the northe, for then wee see more of the skye (that waies) aboue our Horizont, then we did see before: but if we go toward the South, then will the Pole seeme lower and lower, still as we go Southward: not bycause the Pole chaungeth, but our Horizont chaungeth: for nowe wee see more of the skye towarde the Southe, and lesse towarde the Northe: but yet generally as much as wee leefe in the one parte, so muche wee wynne in the other coaste, so that euermore we may see halfe the skye.<note place="margin">Whether the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonte doo moue or not.</note>

               <p>Then this is my doubte, how I shal vnderstand your former woordes: for I remembre you sayd that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rizont was a circle immouable, and did not turne as the cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles in heauen do: <hi>&amp;</hi> now you haue plainly declared that the Horizonte dothe chaunge, whiche can not be without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>You haue answered your owne question, if you marke it well: for the Horizonte moueth not as the circles in heauen do moue: that is to say, it goeth not round about the earth by a daily course, but it standeth steddye whyle the heauen moueth, so that if you neuer chaunge your place, your Horizont will neuer moue. And to speake more exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly: the Horizont moueth not, thoughe you moue neuer so farre: but rather should we saye, that you are come into an other Horizonte, when you are come into an other
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16115:44"/> cuntrye.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>It muste needes appeare so, nowe that I do con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sider the matter more earnestly: for when I am at London, I see the same Horizonte that all other men there do see: then if I go to Yorke, I see the Horizont of Yorke, and not of London, so that the Horizont of London remaineth as it was, and so doth the Horizont of Yorke, whether I tarry or go. And thus I perceaue great alteration in the Horizonts betwene southe and northe, wherby the pole is diuersly alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in height aboue the Horizont. What if I go eastward or westward, shall I not fynde the lyke alteration?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>It must needes appeare yes. for the same reason that causeth you to chaunge your Horizont betwene south and north, the same will cause it to chaunge betwene east and weste. And for declaration thereof, answere me to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Do you think that there is any suche cuntry farre east from vs,<note place="margin">Example of Calecut.</note> as the Portingales reporte Calecut to be?</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>It can not be. for this muche I maye gether by that I haue learned already, that the rising of the sonne and of all other starres, is the apearing of them aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zonte, so that they rise to vs, when they beginne to appeare aboue our Horizont: and they rise to them in Calecut, whē they appeare aboue their Horizonte. And further I gether now by your briefe admonition of the chaunge of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontes, that as betwene southe <hi>&amp;</hi> northe in our owne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we maye perceaue notable diuersitie, so maye wee consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16115:44"/> twenty times so muche, as was betwene Southhampton and the northe parte of England.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>The distaunce is not so muche, nor the difference so great, but by meanes that the Portingales do saile a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous compasse in goynge thether, they accompte the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce by that compassed course, whiche is farre from oure talke now, for we must euer take right distaunce by a straight line, as often as we do speake of any suche matter. how be it for examples sake, suppose it to be. 6000. miles east from vs,<note place="margin">The diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the day in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> it seemeth to be more then a quarter of the whole compasse of all the earthe, (as I will proue it in the nexte treatise) and therfore must the Sonne at the leaste rise 6. houres to them soner then it dothe to vs. do you perceaue that?</p>

               <p>The Son (as all men knoweth) doth compasse all the earthe in 24. houres, then muste it compas halfe the earthe in 12. houres, and a quarter of the earthe in 6. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. this is as plaine as can be: <hi>&amp;</hi> thē it must needes folow, that if they bee a quarter of the earthe more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the east then we, they must see the Son 6. houres sooner then wee.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>That is plaine. for if all those places had one Horizonte, then should the sonne rise to them all at ones.</p>

               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>Yes for soothe.

Wherfore it muste needes appeare, that the son when he runneth in anye of those three circles, is lyke tyme aboue the Horizont, as he is vnder it, so must the daies and the nyghts be equall, not only when the son is in the equino<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctiall circle, but also when he is in any of the both tropykes: but this equalitye of dayes and nyghtes, when the sonne is in any tropike, is priuately appropried to the ryght sphere: for in all other varieties of the Bowinge spheres, then is the greateste difference in all the yeare, betweene the day and the nyghte, when the sonne is in any of the tropikes. as for example: Set the sphere to what eleuation that you lyst. that is to saye: Raise the Pole as many degrees aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonte as you will.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doothe appeare sufficientlye, that vnder the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the worlde, it is halfe a yeare continuall daye, and the other halfe yeare,<note place="margin">The length of the daye vnder the Poles of the worlde.</note> contynuall nyghte, bicause so longe againe the Sonne is not seene aboue that Horizonte.</p>

               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>This is as true as canne bee. the reason of it is so certayne and manifeste, that I coulde not better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the state of that place, if I were there to see it, then I doo by thys beholdynge of the Sphere, and the motion of it. And thys (as I take it) is a meruaylous excellencye in knowledge,<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencye of knowledge.</note> to bee able so certaynly to iudge of thinges absente, as if they were present: to bee able to tell
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16115:47"/> what houre of the daye it is in all the partes of the earthe, and when the Sonne ryseth and setteth in all nations vnder heauen.</p>

               <p>Yow wolde accompt this knowledge more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous, if you vnderstoode other more wonderfull conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in it, whiche hereafter I will vtter as I shall haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conuenient: but in the meane season, I will shewe you two or three conclusions, appertaining to our presente matter whiche we haue in hande.</p>
               <p>As the houres of the daye are dyuers in dyuers regions, so the shadowes that the sonne causeth in their dialles, and all other shadows, doth disagree many waies, not only from our shadowes, but also one of them from an other. Againe the times of the yeare are not alyke through all the worlde, but when it is Sommer to vs, it is winter to som other: and when it is Springe time with vs, it is sommer in an other cuntrye: and when it is Haruest with vs, other people haue sommer: so when it is Winter with vs, som nations haue sommer: yea when the spring time beginneth with vs, it is haruest in some cuntries, and in other cuntries it is midsommer at the same time: but when it is midsōmer with vs, it it haruest no where in the worlde, but midde winter it is then in two diuers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the worlde.</p>

               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>This talke is meruailous, and in mine opinion the greatest meruaile is, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you can vnderstand the shadowes of their dials or any other thinges, in all partes of the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Peraduenture it wold seem more merueilous if I shoulde say, that by the knowledge of the shadow of a staffe, or any thing els that standeth vpright, (if I heare it trulye reported) I will tell you in what part of the worlde that sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe was marked. And thinke you this no meruell, to tarry within Englande, and yet to measure all the compasse of the earthe, as certenly, as any man can do it, by going rounde about the earthe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>These thinges do exceede credit, saue that other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16115:48"/> thinges, whiche before I iudged impossible, and now I know them certenly, do perswade me to thinke many thinges pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by learning, that seeme vnpossible to the ignoraunte, thoughe their wittes be neuer so good. I heare suche men say sometimes, that learned men and farre trauelers may be per mitted to talke at their pleasure, syth no man canne comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll them.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>By those woordes they signifie, that they do not credite all that learned men do write or saye: wherfore I will constantly saye to them, that if they wolde vouchsafe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye somtyme in learninge, they shoulde be easilye perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not onlye to beleue suche thinges as nowe they thynke impossible, but also to know them so certenly, as they know howe many fingers they haue. But to perswade you in the meane ceason,<note place="margin">Thre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</note> I will presently shew you some of these thre conclusions before named, I meane for the generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the times of the year: for the declining of shadowes in diuers nations: and for the ordre to measure the whole earthe, and yet go not out of England.</p>

               <p>Here you see for Southehampton, where the fyrste eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken, no myles sette, bicause it is the beginning of your iourneye, but the eleuation of the Pole there is 51. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: then at Newecastell the heighte of the Pole is 55. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and that is more then the other by foure degrees, so that foure degrees muste be set downe for their difference in degrees, and their distaunce in equall myles, is 240. Nowe to see howe many myles do the answere to a degree, I do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide 240. by 4. and the quotient will be 60. wherfore I saye,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16115:49"/> that 60. miles in earthe (by this triall) doth answere to one degree in heauen. Then at Edynburghe I finde the eleuatiō of the Pole to be 57, that is twoo degrees more then it was at Newcastell, and the distaunce betweene them in myles, is 120, whiche if I dyuide by 2, the quotient will be 60. as it was before: so that one of these workes doth confirme the other, bicause they agre so iustly.</p>

               <p>I vnderstande all this, as by declaringe of the thirde woorke it shall appeare to you. At Catnesse pointe, the Pole is 62. degrees aboue the Horizont, whiche maketh 5. degrees more then it was at Edenburghe, and the space betwene those two places is 300. myles: now if I diuide 300. by fiue, there will amounte 60, whiche quotient doth agree with the other twoo before found: so it appeareth that in all Englande, 60. mile in earthe, answereth to a degree of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the skye.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>It were againste reason, seynge that the latitude of Wardehouse is greater then our latitude is, and lyeth on the same coaste of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall: for in the former examples the two places were on the contrarye coaste of the Equinoctiall from vs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>I see it well now, so that by reason I must needes adde it to our eleuation, and so ther amounteth 72. degrees, whiche is one degree more then you did affirme it to haue in latitude, in your former declaration.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>The cause is this: that rate of 60 myles to eche degree doth serue in goyng precisely from southe to north, but nother is Wardhouse iust northe from vs, but somwhat towarde the easte. nother yet in the other two examples any of bothe places was directly southe from vs, for the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>londe of Affrike beareth towarde the easte, and the Streight of Magellanus bendeth towarde the weste, yet for this tyme it maye serue as well for our purpose, as if it were more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely doone.</p>

               <p>What so euer is taught to be retained for a truth, oughte to be a very certaine truth in deede: and they do not well that in suche manner doo teache fyrste vntruthes for truthes. but where inductiō is made by examples, it is often tymes more or at the leaste, no lesse expedient to vse exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not exactly true, then to take only precyse true exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for thereby it appeareth the proofe to bee of greater force, if it will procede in an example whiche is not precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. And in these examples we haue so large scope of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that we neede not sticke for two or thre degrees, for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende not to speake particularly of any citye that is vnder

               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>Yea that ther be, aboue 29 degrees besouthe the tropike of Capricorne: for that tropike is but 23 degrees and a half beyond the equinoctiall: and ther be inhabitants 53. degrees beyond the equinoctiall, as before is shewed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Well if there dwell men but 6 degrees besouth the tropike of Capricorn (for I sayde before, I would not sticke with you for a fewe degrees, sith I wold make my proofe the more forceable) then I demaund of you, whiche way dooth the sonne stande from them at noonetide?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>It must needes be alwaies northe from them at noone, as it is alwaies southe from vs at noone, seynge they are beyonde the southe Tropike, towarde the Southe, as we are beyonde the north Tropike towarde the northe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Then consider two places that stande iuste south and northe (bicause you like well a precisenes in examples) as Venice that famous citie standeth north almost from the cape of Good hope: Now consider the matter thus: in these two places there is one common meridiane line, sith thei do stand almost iuste southe and north the one from the other: then when the sonne is in the Meridiane line of Venice, is hee not also in the Meridrane lyne to them that dwell at the sayd Cape of Affrike?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Then those twoo places haue their noone tydes at one hower.</p>

               <p>And at Venice theyr shaddowe goeth alwaies at noone toward the north <hi>&amp;</hi> neuer toward the southe, bicause
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16115:52"/> it is far north from the northerly tropike, called the tropike of Cancer, and so is the foresaid cape of Affrike far southe, beyonde the southe tropike, whiche is the tropike of Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne: wherefore (as you haue confessed) their shaddowe at noone tyde, must needes go all tymes of the yeare toward the southe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar,</speaker>

               <p>That immitation seemeth straunge yet were it bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to make new english names, then to lacke words: therefore I will not refuse to vse them, till I can learn more apt names. but I praye you, where do those men dwell, that haue their shaddowes runnyng so about them?</p>

               <p>Within the Polare circles: for all people whose zenith is within 23 degrees and a halfe of anye of bothe the Poles, haue their shaddowes running rounde aboute them. but as I shewed you before, the nearer they dwell vnder the Pole, the longer is theyr daye: and therefore the oftener doothe theyr shaddowes runne about them for where the daye is but 24 houres longe, there the shaddowe runneth but ones aboute: and where it is halfe a yeare longe, there it runneth aboute 183 tymes: and in all other meane places raccodingly.</p>

               <p>This is manifest ynoughe by your former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the lengthe of the dayes, and the course of the sonne.

               <p>Then do they not wante lyghte (thoughe they lacke the sonne) but only halfe a moneth togither, when the Moone is in that halfe of the Zodiake, which is out of their Horizonte.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>That is well considered of you. And yet euerye moneth they lacke not lyghte, thoughe bothe the sonne and the Moone also bee oute of their sighte: for as you see with vs, that we haue lyghte before the sonne rising, and after the sonne setting, so haue they suche a lyghte by the beames of the Sonne 50 dayes continuallye after they haue loste the sighte of the sonne, and so haue they the like lighte 50. daies continuall, before the sonne doth rise to them.</p>

               <p>Then they wante not the sonne lyght but only 82. daies, although they see not the sonne in halfe a year, and yet halfe that 82. daies they haue the mone in their sighte, as I perceaue by your former lessons: for seing she goeth about the Zodiake euerye moneth, she must needes bee halfe that tyme in that parte of the Zodiake whiche is alwaies aboue their Horizonte. This contemplation deliteth me muche, to marke places absente, as if I were present, and to see their alterations by reason more certenly, then I can do by sense, if I were there presently.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16115:54"/> knowledge of the times of the year, in all parts of the world. When the sonne is at the highest with vs,<note place="margin">The thirde conclusion is declared.</note> it is at the lowest with diuers other nations, namelye to all them that dwell other vnder the Equinoctiall circle directly, other southe from it: and therefore all those nations haue mydde winter, when wee haue midde sommer.

               <p>In deede the streight of Magellanus is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for here I meane by a Region that whiche the Grekes do call a Climate, whiche is in forme lyke to those Zones, whiche I did describe before,<note place="margin">A <hi>Climate.</hi>
                  </note> saue that there are more suche Climates or regions, then there are Zones: for the climates may well be accompted 48 betwene the twoo polare circles,<note place="margin">The nōber of climates</note> whiche containeth but three of the Zones. but of those cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats I will say no more at this present, but that euery regiō where the longest day is half an hour longer or shorter then it is in anye other region, must bee accompted in a seuerall climate from it: so that vnder the equinoctiall the longest daye is but 12. houres, and with vs in the myddle of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande, it is about 18. houres: wherefore we must accompt that the myddle of Englande is in the 12. clymate from the Equinoctiall northwarde, and they that dwell 66. degrees and a halfe north, or southe from the Equinoctiall, bicause their longest day is of 24. houres, that is twelue howers lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then it is in the myddle of the worlde vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall (from which all those accomptes of Climates do be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin) they must be iudged in the 24.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>Then are there 24. climates on eche syde of the Equinoctiall, betwene it and the polare circles, yet I remem brethat the common authors make mention but only of 7. on either side, whiche maketh but 14. in all.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That shalbe answered anone, where I will set out
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16115:55"/> the ordre and reason of the diuer sity of the climates: but for this time it shall suffise that you consider this, that all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces within one Climate, haue the tymes of the yeare alyke exactely,<note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</note> and their dayes styll of lyke quantitie the one to the other, and they that dwell in the contrarye climate, as many degres on the other side of the Equinoctial, the haue bothe the times of the yeare contrary, and also the quantity of the daies disagreable, for when it is sommer in the one cli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mate, it is winter in the other and when the daye in the one dothe increase, the nighte in the other dothe increase after the same quantitie iuste.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>Then for example: In the cuntrye about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellanus streighte, it is sommer when wee haue winter: and when our daye is at the longest then is their nyghte at the longest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Truthe it is, and when wee haue springe, then is their haruest: and so is it common to all them that dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe the earthe within those twoo climates, yet is there this difference, that in our climate and theirs also we maye ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine four quarters equally distincte: the firste quarter being that which we dwell in,<note place="margin">Euery Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate hathe <hi>4</hi> quarters</note> and in the contrary climate, our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian circle limiteth the first quarter, <hi>&amp;</hi> also the third quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in both places, so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in this first quarter in both climates, the times of the day and night at a like: for when it is noone to vs, it is no one to them: and when it is midnight to them, it is midnight also to vs.</p>

               <p>Ye are far deceiued, for then of necessitie muste it folow, that their daye and ours at one time should be of (one quantity, which is not true, as I said before, but the reason of that shalbe shewed anone, yet is it true, that their houres agre with our houres if their meridian circle agre with ours.

               <p>You haue doone well in bothe pointes. for as the numbre of writers are infinite, so haue I founde great tedious payne in readinge a great multitude of them.

Cleomedes the greeke authour, is very woorthye to bee often readde: but beste in hys owne tongue, for the latine booke is muche corrupted. Also Euclide his booke entituled Phaenomena, and Stoffler his commentaries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Proclus Sphere: whyche booke I wishe were well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognised (as it hathe greate neede) then myghte it serue in steede of a greate numbre of other bookes. Dyuers Englyshe menne haue written right well in that argument: as Grostehed, Michell Scotte, Batecombe, Baconthorpe,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16115:58"/> and other dyuers, but fewe of their bookes are printed as yet, therefore I will staye at those three for this tyme. As for Plinye, Hyginius, Aratus, and a greate manye other, are to bee readde onlye of masters in suche arte, that can iudge the chaffe from the corne. and Prolemye that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye writer and myracle in nature, is to harde for younge schollars, except they be fyrste instructed not onlye in the principles of the Sphere, but also well traded in Euclides his Geometrye, and also well exercised in the Theorykes of the Planetes.

And that is the cause why all men vse to saye, when they expresse their stay in lyuing: Suche is my fortune.

               <p>One stronge reason for the varietie of howers is gathered by the eclipses duly obserued, and namely of the Moone,, for as it happeneth at one instance of time, so is it not one hower to all nations. As for example:<note place="margin">Examples of eclipses.</note> This year of 1556, the eclipse of the Moone shall be with vs the 17 day of Nouembre at 3. of the clocke in the morninge, and to them at Calecut it shall be at 9. of the clocke in the morning: yea we shall see the Moone in the southwest, and they shall not see her at the same instant, for she will be to them vnder the horizonte in the northwest. like waies in the yeare of 1562. there shall be a great eclipse of the Moone with vs, whiche shall endure aboue three houres and an halfe, and yet shall they at Calecut see no part of it, by reason that the Moone shall be farre vnder their horizont before that eclipse begin. And in lyke manner this laste yeare 1555. was there a greate eclipse of the Moone the fifte daye of Iune, at three of the clocke in the morning, yet in Calecut there was none eclipse
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16115:68"/> seene then, for the Moone was set vnder their horizont two howers almost before the eclipse began. But in the yeare of 1551. when we had the eclipse of the Moone at 9. of the clock at night, the 20. day of February, they at Calecut sawe that eclipse at thre of the clocke in the morning the nexte daye, as the Portingales that were there can testifye. Wherby it is manifest, that their Horizont doth not agree with ours, and thereof doth it folowe that the earth is not flatte. But nowe to returne to Cleomedes againe, (vnto whose wordes I haue added but the examples of the eclipses) his seconde reason against the flatnesse of the earth, is this.</p>

Then if bothe those lines be per pendicular to one flatte plaine, or to one line standinge for that plaine flatte, all the angles that they bothe doo make with the thyrde lyne A B, muste bee righte angles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the definition of a perpendiculer line. Nowe if all their angles be right, then are they all equall accordynge to the fourthe grauntable request in the seconde booke of the Pathway, that all righte angles be equall eche to other. And if all their angles be equal, then must their matche angles be equall of sorce: wherby it doth folow accordinge to the is. Theoreme of the seconde booke of the Pathway, that those two perpendicular lines be paralleles, seyng that on 2 righte lines, as A C and B D, there is drawen a thyrde ryghte line A B, crossewayes, and maketh twoo matche corners of the one lyne, equall wyth the lyke twoo matche corners of the other lyne.</p>

               <p>Nowe therefore will I retourne to Cleomedes argument. They that dwell at Lysimachia (in Grece) <hi>&amp;</hi> thei that dwell at Syene (in the southe parte of Egypte) haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them in distaunce 20000 furlonges (that is 2500 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les) wherefore it must solowe that their zenithes in the skye be no farther a sonder, seyng they be limited by two perpen diculers equallye distaunte: but it is well knowen by good proofe of instrumentes, that Syene is vnder the Tropike of Cancer directly, and Lysimachia is vnder the hedde of the North dragon, which 2 places in the skye are iustly pro ued to be a sonder the 15 part of the whole compas of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that is the first part of the diameter of the skye. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore if 20000 furlonges be the first parte of the diameter, the whole diameter must be but 100000 furlonges: <hi>&amp;</hi> the whole compas of the skie muste be but 300000 furlonges, and of these furlonges it is prooued, that the earthe contayneth in compas 250000. so is the heauen lyttle bygger then the earthe in compas whiche absurditie maye easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the Sonne, whiche in comparison to the skye, is a verye lytle parte of it, and yet is bygger than the earthe mannye folde: whereby anye manne maye see what ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditye foloweth that opinion, to thynke that the earthe is flatte.</p>

               <p>That is true: but yet these 2 partes are as farre vnequal in quantity as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>&amp;</hi> earth ar vnlike in their compas, wherfore to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that frō henceforth you shall not mistake it againe, I wil by lineary demonstratiō set before your eyes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and difference of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16115:70"/> them bothe more plainly then curiously.</p>
               <p>Here in this figure you see two circles drawen vppon one centre, their common centre being G, from which there are drawen to the vttermost circle two right lines G A, <hi>&amp;</hi> G D, these lines do crosse the lesser circle in 2 pointes E and F, fro whiche two pointes I haue drawen twoo paralleles, vnto the circumference of the greater circle, whiche two paralleles be B E, and C F. Nowe may I say, that bicause these two circles be made vpon one common centre, and twoo lynes drawen from that centre to the circumference of the both circles, bicause A G D is one common angle in them bothe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are there arche lynes inclosed betweene those two ryght lynes lyke in proportion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>I perceaue it well: so that if the arche lyne A D in the greater circle, be the syxte parte of it, then is E F the arche lyne of the lesser circle, the syxte parte of his owne circle, in lyke manner. but yet that arche of the lesser circle is not so greate as the lyke arche in the bygger circle.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Then what saye you of the arche B C, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to the arche E F, whiche bothe arches are betweene twoo lines paralleles?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>They muste needes bee equall, seynge there is iuste as muche distaunce betweene E F, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene B C.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>So maye you nowe perceaue what difference it is to saye, that two arches of two seuerall circles, are like in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portion; and to saye that they are equall in quantity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schollar.</speaker>
               <p>Nowe I perceaue it plainly, that although 4 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and an half (as your former reason did import) be like in proportion to the whole circumference of heauen, as 270 miles are in comparison to the compasse of the earthe: yet it foloweth not that they should be equall togither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>But supposynge the earthe to bee flatte, then it foloweth as I haue declared beefore, that they are equalle in quantitye, seeynge bothe beetoken the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16115:71"/> distant of one couple of paralleles. And thē it foloweth, that seinge 4 degrees <hi>&amp;</hi> a half is the four score part of the compas of heauen, if I multiply 270 myles (whiche is equall to it) by 80, therof will amounte the numbre of myles that make the compasse of heauen, whiche are 21600 myles.

                  </figure> For declaratiō of which saying by line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ari demōstration I think good to drawe a figure, wherin you may aptly se the force of his reason. The vttermost circle of <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16115:83"/> woulde darken all the starres is so muche space of the skye, which is nyghe hande a quarter of that hemisphere that is aboue our horizont. And as the shaddow tourneth about accordyng to the motion of the Sonne, so in four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye howers all the starres that be nyghe vnto the zodiake, should suffre eclipse: whiche thinge is contrary to dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, for wee see there (about the zodiake and againste the sonne) the starres very bright.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>This reason doth suppose, that the starres do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue their light of the sonne, which thinge was not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by you, althoughe I thinke it to be true, yet in a good argument, no doubtfull sentence may be alleged.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>The like inconuenience will follow, if the son and the earth were both of one greatnes, as are B <hi>&amp;</hi> G in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer figure, for so wolde the shaddow run of one bignes like a roller, as is represented by E, and wold darkē diuers stars, and namelye all that bee in the myddle of the Zodiake, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16115:83"/> the moone should both oftener be eclipsed (then in deed she is) by the greatnes of the shaddowe, and wold tarry longer in the eclipse, by that same reason, then good reason wold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. But seing we perceaue no starres directlye against the sonne to be eclipsed, nother yet the mone, in suche forme as that pyllerlyke shaddow would cause, we must needes thinke that the shaddowe is muche abated, beefore it come to the sphere of the moone, and is cleane consumed before it come at anye of the starres, whiche kinde of abatement could not be, but where the light is much greater then is the body that maketh the shaddow, as is C in comparison to G.</p>

               <p>So must it followe, that seyng the Sonne is the lyghte body, and the earthe giueth the shaddowe, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitye the Sonne muste be greater then the earthe.</p>

               <p>Yet haue I farther matter of profe, that the earth is not only a very small bodye in regarde to the skie, but is without anye vewe of greatnes in that comparison.</p>
               <p>If the earthe had anye notable quantitye in respecte of the skye,<note place="margin">The second reason for the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the earthe. &amp;c</note> then muste the diameter of the earthe haue as greate a quantitie, in comparison to the diameter of the skie. for as in twoo circles the proportion of the diameters is equall to the proportion of the circumferences, so is the proportiō of the shorter to the longer, greater then is the proportion of their two platte formes: but in two globes the proportiō of the shorter diameter to the longer, is muche greater then is the rate of their platte formes: and yet muche more great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter then the proportion of the lesser globe to the bygger.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>That is sufficiently proued in Geometry, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may proceede with your conclusion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>If the diameter of the earth haue notable quantity in cōparison to the diameter of the skie, then the stars which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16115:84"/> ar ouer our headdes, be nygher vnto vs by a notable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, then when they be in the easte, or in the west.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>But if it shall be so accompted in regarde to the halfe diameter of the skie, then must the stars ouer our heds seeme bigger by a notable quantitye, then when they are in the easte or weste.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>That reason is not only approued by Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye, but also by cōmon sight and daily experience, that the nigher any thing is to the sighte, the greater it seemeth: and the farther from the sighte, the lesser it sheweth.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>There is no suche diuersity perceaued in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the starres, but that they appeare styll constantly of one bignes: wherfore it must follow, that their distance is all one in all partes of the skye, and then doth not the semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the earth make anye notable diuersitie in distance: wherefore it must be thought that the quantitye of it is not sensible in comparison to the semidiameter of heauen, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the circumference of it in comparison to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the skye, and muche more may not the whole quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titye of it bee accompted sensible in respecte to the whole quantitie of the worlde.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schol.</speaker>
               <p>That foloweth well: for as I learned in Geometry, if the diameters of any two Globes, be in suche proportion that the greater do contain the lesser a thousand times, then be their circumferences in the same rate: but the platte forme of the greater, is 1000000 folde greater then the lesser: and the whole substance of the bigger globe, doth containe the smaller globe, 1000000000 tymes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Vndoubtedly it maye bee perceaued by sight as well in dialles, as other greater instrumentes made for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations, that the semidiameter of the sonne his sphere is more then a thousand times longer then the semidiameter
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16115:84"/> of the earthe, els wolde not the shadowes agree so exactly as they do: for they moue as duely and ordrely about the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of all suche instrumentes, as if their centre were the very centre of the world. which thinge could not be, if those two centres dyd differ notably, in respecte to the sphere of the Sonne. And if it were not, that an introduction dooth not admitte the exacte proofes of the arte, I could herby declare the proportion of these two semidiameters so exactly, that you should confesse that proofe to bee righte certaine and good. But now wil I procede to the declaration of this third reason by linearye demonstration, although it be somwhat obscure, without other helpe.</p>

               <p>Nowe I vnderstande the forme of woorkinge for tryall of this matter.

After iuste multipli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation and diuision, as that rule dooth importe, I fynde the whole diameter of the sonne to containe in myles, 36853: where as the earth (as before is noted) dooth containe in his diameter
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16115:87"/> but 6872 myles. So that therby it appeareth, that the sonne is more then 5 tymes so broade as the earthe is ouerthwart.</p>

               <p>That is well limited. for els if the flat of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test circle of the whole earthe myght appeare vnto vs, as the flatte forme of the sonne doth, the flatte forme of the sonne ought to be accompted about 29 times so great as the earth is, in lyke forme.

               <p>In what proportion so euer the sides of any twoo squares be, those squares are in the square of that proportion: so that if the sides be as 2 to 1, the squares are as 4 to 1: and if the sydes be as 3 to 1, the squares are as 9 to 1. &amp;c. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde rule is this: In what rate so euer the sydes of any cubes be, the cubes do beare the lyke rate cubikly multiplied. as if the sydes be as two to one, the cubes are as 8 to 1: and if the sydes be as thre to one, the cubes are as 27 to 1. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>This is well applied of you, that you can frame your common rules in Geometry to suche speciall matters. And nowe may you proue the lyke in the moone.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sc.</speaker>
               <p>You say, that the circumference of the sphere of <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> mone is 724604 myles, and 4/7: then diuidyng it by 360, ther wil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the quantitie of one degree: whiche yeldeth in this rate 2012 myles and 71/90: but accomptinge the breadth of the moone 31 minutes and a halfe, the myles that answere vnto it, are but 1057: wherby it foloweth, that the diameter of the earthe being 6872, is 6 times and a halfe greater then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the moone. And therfore the flatte of the earthe in his greatest circle, is aboue 42 tymes so greate, as the like flatte forme in the moone: and the whole globe of the earth is 273 tymes so greate, as the whole globe of the moone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>In this accompt you take the innermost circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the sphere of the moone, and in the like accompt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16115:87"/> manye other take the vttermoste circumference, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth more reasonable to take the myddle distaunce bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them bothe, whiche is 1055302. (as here by example dooth appeare <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>So it seemeth most indifferent reason. And then the measure of one degree wyll be 2931 71/180 and of that there will aunswere to the diameter of the mone (being accompted 31 minutes and a halfe) 1539 myles. Nowe if I diuide the diameter of the earthe (whiche is 6872) by it, there wyll be in the quotient 4 and a halfe almost: so wyll it appeare that the diameter of the earth is 4 times and a halfe almoste so longe as the diameter of the moone: and the flat of the earth 20 times so large as the flat of the moone. And the whole earthe nynetye tymes so greate as the globe of the Moone.</p>

               <p>Yet according to the common accompt, the earth is but 39 tymes so muche as the moone: but hereof and of many other thynges that seeme aboue the reache of mannes witte, I will an other time instructe you farther. for it is no meete mater for an introduction. And thys is broughte for exaumples sake onlye, that you myghte vnderstande the ordre of suche sorte of woorkynge, and therby learne to trye your authors sayinges. But nowe it is tyme to proceede to other matters, and to declare the true place of the earthe, and to prooue that it standeth in the myddle of the worlde, whiche thinge althoughe it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlye bee gathered by that that is written beefore,<note place="margin">That the earthe is in the middle of the worlde.</note> yet I wyll declare certayne inuincible reasons for confutation of them that mysseplace it. And to begyn with all, there can be but three dyuersities of places in generall, without the centre of the worlde: for other it muste bee beside the Axetree of the worlde, and yet equallye distaunte from bothe the Poles, or els it muste bee on the Axe tree of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16115:88"/> the worlde, and yet nearer to one Pole then to an other: or thyrdlye it muste bee beside the Axe tree of the worlde, and also nearer to the one Pole then to the other. beside these three varieties there is lefte but one more (whyche is the true placynge of it) and that is to be on the Axe tree of the worlde, equallye distaunte from bothe the Poles: wherefore if the firste three opinions bee reproued as false, this fourthe must needes remaine as onlye true. And nowe for the confutynge of the three fyrste opinions I will vse Ptolemyes argumentes, augmentyng them with a larger explication.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō of the first opiniō</note>If the earthe were out of the centre of the worlde, and yet stode in the middle betweene bothe the Poles, then shoulde not the Horizonte cutte the skye into twoo equall halues.

<figure>

                  </figure> As for example: If you would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the earthe to stand as L dooth in this figure, then woulde the Horizont be the righte line E L F, and so the parte that is vnder the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont is greater then the other parte of the skye aboue the Horizonte: wherefore in the ryghte Sphere the nyghte muste needes alwaies be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the daye. but if you would imagine the earth to stand where M, is set vnderneth K, which is the verye centre of the worlde, then woulde that Horizonte G M H, whiche answereth to that centre, be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16115:88"/> it. And by the like reasons in al other bowing sphers ther shoulde bee no equalitye betweene the daye and the nyght: and if there were any, it should not be in that time when the sonne were in the iuste middle betweene the twoo Tropikes, (that is vnder the Equinoctiall line) bicause that the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall line is not equally parted by the Horizont, but the greater parte is aboue the Horizont, after the one suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and after the other supposition it is vnder the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont of the earthe.</p>

               <p>And farther you may perceaue (as all men, in all ages, and in all nations do confesse) that the increase of the dayes from the shortest to the meane, and from the meane daye to the longest are not onlye agreeable betweene them selues, but are lyke also exactlye to the decrease of the daies from the longest to the meane, and from the meane to the shorteste. whiche thynge coulde not bee, excepte that the myddle circle betweene the twoo Tropikes (whiche is ryghtlye called the Equinoctiall circle) were equallye dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by the horizonte into twoo iuste halues. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: seeyng there can be no position of suche obliquity (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be righte vnder the Pole) but some one circle of the Sonnes course must be diuided equallye into two partes by the Horizonte, so that when the Sonne were in that circle, the daye woulde be equall with the nyght: which thing as all nations confesse, happeneth at one tyme to all menne, and that is when the Sonne is in the beginning of Aries or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, precisely vnder the Equinoctiall lyne: wherefore not onlye that circle dooth ryghtly agree with hys name, but also it foloweth that the same Equinoctiall line is equallye parted into twoo iuste partes by the Horizonte. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the earthe muste needes bee iudged to bee in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the worlde.</p>

               <p>The reste is easye to considre: I meane that all shaddowes runne in a right line from the lyght bodye, that causeth that shadow: so that the sonne being in D, which is the iuste easte, wolde cast the shaddowes in the earthe, not to F (which is the west in the earth) but to H, which is almoste northwest: and therefore is your maior duely proued, and the seconde opinion fully confuted: but how may the thirde opinion be answered?</p>

                  <note place="margin">Against the thirde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note>The thirde opinion is, that the earthe standeth out of the axe tree of the worlde, and also nearer to the one pole then to the other: so doth it containe both the other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: wherfore seyng they both are reproued, this third muste needes see me falser then ony of them bothe, bycause it includeth all the vntruthe of them bothe. And therfore to conclude with Ptolemye, <note place="margin">A confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> the increase and decrease of dayes coulde neuer be so ratable and iustly proportioned as they be, if the earthe stoode any where els, then in the very centre of the worlde. And farther more the eclipses of the moone shuld not happē, <note place="margin">An other reason.</note> (as now they do) at the precise hour of ful opposition, if the earthe were not in the very centre of the worlde: for considering that all the thre bodies of the Son,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16115:90"/> the moone, and the earthe muste needes be in one right line (as in the doctrine of those eclipses it is taught) there is no place in the worlde, where the earth may stand in that right line common to all suche eclipses, but only the centre of the worlde:
<figure>
                     <figDesc>Geometric diagram.</figDesc>
                  </figure> as for examples sake I haue noted 4 seuerall eclipses of the moone: the first was in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> year of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes incarnation 1551, the 20 day of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arye, when the Sonne was aboute the 12 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Pisces, and the moone aboute the 12 degre of Virgo. The seconde eclipse was in the yeare of 1553, the sonne being in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth degree of Leo, and the moone in the eleuenth degree of Aquarius: The thirde eclipse happened on the fifte daye of Iune, 1555, the sonne being in the 23 degre of Gemini, and the mone in the 23 of Sagittary. The fourth eclipse, shalbe this yeare 1556, the 17 daye of Nouembre, at whiche time the sonne shalbe in the fifte degre of Sagittary, and the moone in the fifte degree of Gemini. Nowe if you lyste to take more examples, for farther tryall you maye so doo. yet two seuerall eclipses serue as well for this proofe as 10000. And then drawing lines for eche eclipse frō the place of the sonne to the place of the moone, all those lines muste needes passe by the earthe, and there is none other pointe, whereby they all (or any two of them) can passe, but onlye the centre of the Zodiak, (which is the centre of the world) therefore muste that centre of necessitie bee accompted the place of the earthe. And this may suffice for this time tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the earthe and his accidentes, principallye appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16115:91"/> to Astronomye: for althoughe manye other thinges are to bee considered in it, they appertaine rather to philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers or Cosmographers, then to Astronomers, and namely in the doctrine of the principles. <note place="margin">Whether the earthe moue or not.</note> As touching the distinction of the zones, I haue sayde somwhat before, &amp; som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>what more wil I say anon. But as for the quietnes of the earth I neede not to spende anye tyme in proouing of it, syth that opinion is so firmelye fixed in moste mennes headdes, that they accōpt it mere madnes to bring the question in doubt. And therfore it is as muche follye to trauaile to proue that which no man denieth, as it were with great study to diswade that thinge, which no man doth couette, nother any manne alloweth: or to blame that which no manne praiseth, nother anye manne lyketh.</p>

               <p>And so doo some men iudge of this matter, for not only Eraclides Ponticus, a great Philosopher, and two great clerkes of Pythagoras schole, Philolaus and Ecphan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus, were of the contrary opinion, but also Nicias Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, and Aristarchus Samius, seeme with strong arguments to approue it: but the reasons are to difficulte for this firste Introduction, &amp; therfore I wil omit them till an other time. And so will I do the reasons that Ptolemy, Theon &amp; others doo alleage, to prooue the earthe to bee without motion: and the rather, bycause those reasons doo not proceede so demonstrablye, but they may be answered fully, of him that holdeth the contrarye. I meane, concerning circularre mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: marye direct motion out of the centre of the world, seemeth more easy to be confuted, and that by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whiche were before alleaged for prouing the earthe to be in the middle and centre of the worlde.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16115:92"/> distances and ordre there maye bee some varietie, at the leaste in diuers places, therefore I will speake a little of them againe. <note place="margin">Equinoctial</note> First for the equinoctiall, there is but one tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe all the world, and he is equally distaunt from eche Pole, and therefore is called the Girdle of the skye: hys office was declared beefore to bee the lymite of the myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the world, in whiche the Son maketh the dayes equall to the nyghtes. Also hee declareth the true easte and west, and is not onlye the common measure wherby all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are iudged in quantitye, but also it is the true measure of motions celestiall, and the very rule to iudge all ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by, <note place="margin">the tropiks</note> as hereafter more largely shall appeare.

               <p>Which words may be englished thus. What man (saith Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidonius) wold assigne the Arctike circles to be as bounds to the tempera te zones? seing those circles ar not in euery Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: nother do they continue vniforme and of one sort to all cuntries. These wordes (saith Strabo) that they be not in euery climate, maketh nothing to the reproofe. for it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that they be incident to all the inhabitants of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zone, in respect to whom alone that temperate zone beareth his name: but those other woordes, that they keepe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16115:95"/> not one vnforme manner in all places, but are diuersly chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged▪ that is well alleaged. Also Posidonius him selfe when he distincteth the zones, doth say, that fiue zones are needefull and sufficient for celestiall obseruations: whereof two which be vnder the poles, are caled Perisciae, or Round shadowed, bicause their shaddowes run round about them. And these zones extend to that place; there the tropik circles and the Arctike circles are all one. After these there do follow two other, which reache from thence vnto those partes, that are directly vnder the tropiks: and these haue their noone shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe running one waies styll▪ and therfore are called Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rofciae, or Single shadowed. The fift zone lyeth betwene the tropikes, and casteth the noone shadows 2 waies, wherefore the Greekes call it Amphiscion, that is Double shadowed. Scholar. By this translation (which is worth a paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis) I doo not onlye perceaue the sence of these wordes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che before were darke, partly for the hardnes of the matter, and partlye for the hypallage, in changinge of the speakers person, but also I espye the monstrous shape of the old tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>slation.

               <p>His mynde appeareth more manifest anon after where he blameth Polybius, for assigninge those circles as boundes of the zones: whereof one should be inclosed with in that circle, and the other should extend from it to the next tropike then he concludeth thus: that those vnconstant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, may be no boundes of certentye.</p>

               <p>You maye not weighe the matter by auctoritye, for so shoulde that former doctrine continue styll, seynge I aleaged for it Parmenides, Aristotle, Polybius, Cleomedes and Proclus, <hi>&amp;</hi> against them only Posidonius and Strabo, which maye seeme the weaker in numbre: but then considre that the firste sort bring only affirmation for their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and bare autoritye: the other, confute theym by good reason and substantiall argumentes, whiche are farre to bee esteemed aboue anye autoritye.</p>

               <p>Then credityng reason against autority, I must say, that the Zones must be otherwaies diuided, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as I dyd learne of you before, agreable to Iohn de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro bosco his mynde, whom you called the restorer of the Zones.</p>

               <p>Yea in deede: for although Posidonius and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo did teache the like distinction, yet did they not so openly name the true limites, howe bee it in effecte they meane the same: for when Strabo saith, that the Cold zone doth reach to that place, where the Tropike is the Arctike circle, hee dooth meane that there, where this firste Zone endeth, and the temperate Zone beginneth, the Pole is 66 degrees and a halfe aboue the horizonte, and so muste the same Pole bee from the toppe of their headdes in that place 23 degrees and a halfe: in whiche distaunce bicause the Poles of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake do describe a circle, therfore doth Iohn de Sacro bosco call that circle the Arctike circle, in that confounding▪ it in name with an other circle of the Greekes: wherfore I thinke it more reasonable for auoyding confusion, to gyue it a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall name, and call it the Polare circle, and the other to be called styll the Arctike circle,<note place="margin">The Polare circles.</note> as the greeks longe before did name it. And this distinction of the zones by the two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, and the two Polare circles doth distinct exactly those
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16115:96"/> three varieties of shaddowes before mentioned. whiche is a certaine and notable difference, not imagined by men whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che may erre, but wrought by the sonne, which can not erre. But heere muste I admonish you of an other erroure,<note place="margin">An other erroure.</note> gathe red not of grounded reason, but of phantasticall imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by occasion of whiche, this fonde distinction of zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was imagined.</p>
               <p>Bicause the elder Grekes had no trade into the south parts of Afrike, nother the Ethiopians again into Grece, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reason the sonne runneth still ouer their headdes, that dwell betweene the tropikes, manye of the Latines as well as of the Grekes phantasied that there did dwell no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes, neither could dwell there for the vehement heat: wherfore they called it the Burned Zone. And of lyke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion where they moued to accompt two other zones, that be nigh the poles, to be vninhabited for cold, by reason that the sonne doth neuer come nigher to them then the Tropik circles: but how muche herein they were deceaued, it maye be declared not only by reason, and by experience, but also by autority of many of their owne writers, as namely Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosthenes, Posidonius, Polybius, and Ptolemye. but as this is a matter more agreeable to the treatise of Geographye or Cosmography, then of the Sphere, so will I ouerpasse it for this time, and will returne to the reste of the circles of the sphere, amongest which the Zodiake as principall,<note place="margin">The Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake.</note> doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre it selfe, as the common theatre and stage of all the planets motion, and of the chiefe signes and celestiall figures.</p>

               <p>You saye well. That is the common vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, when we speake of the place of the sonne: but bicause other Planettes doo decline from the myddle of that zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake, some tymes towarde the north, and other times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the southe, therfore haue all astronomers appointed a conuenient breadth to the zodiake, according to the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Planets: howe bee it proprelye they doo call that the Latitude of the Planetes,<note place="margin">The lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>netes.

And now appointing the latitude of the zodiake to bee twelue degrees (although
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:16115:97"/> some planetes may runne in latitude on the one side almost 8 degrees) bycause that quantitie is moste receaued, then is euerye signe twelue degrees broad, and thirtie degrees long. and so maketh a longe square: frome the corners of whiche long square, you may imagin lines to be drawē to the centre of the earth: and what so euer commeth within the boundes of those lines, is accompted to bee in that signe: and this is the second signification of a signe.<note place="margin">The thyrde significatiō of a signe. Arcturus. The Pole starre.</note> A third signification ther is, which we vse when we say that the bright starre Arcturus is in Virgine, where as in deed he is aboue 30 degrees north from the Ecliptike line: which is farre out of the breadth of the Zodiake: and so we say that the pole starre is in Taurus, whiche is from the Ecliptike line 66 degrees. and likewayes we name all the starres in the skye to bee in some signe, bee they neuer so farre from the Ecliptike line, and the Zodiak. Therfore to know what is vnderstand by the name of a signe in this signification, you must imagin 6 circles to be so dra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen about the Globe, that they may passe by the beginning of all the signes (for euery circle will serue for two signes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge contrarye one against the other) and so shall the whole Zodiake and all the globe also be parted into twelue equall partes, yf you haue drawen those circles rightly <hi>&amp;</hi> that they do passe al by the two poles of the Zodiak.

And therfore Proclus doth not well distincte this horizont from the other, by naminge the other a sensible horizont, and affirming this to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only by reason, where as in deede we neede reasons helpe more in iudging the other horizont, whiche I thinke moste aptlye to bee called the Earthly horizont,<note place="margin">The Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly horizont</note> bycause it serueth for sightes on the earthe and water onlye, and reacheth not vnto the skie: no, his semidiameter excedeth not (as Macro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bius saith) 180 furlongs, that is 22 myles and a halfe: and his whole diameter cōprehendeth but only 45 myles in length.

But is appeareth that Proclus dydde rather in this doctrine followe some other mennes opinion then hys owne reason, as he dooth also in the declaration of the chaunge of the Horizontes and the Meridianes, for betweene easte and weste, hee saythe that the Meridianes chaunge at the eande of 300 furlonges: but betweene southe and northe hee dooth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe

               <p>Bicause examples do make rules manifest, I pray you let me proue one example. London and Bristow are 94 myles a sonder, and as I haue hearde you saye, they are not muche different in latitude: I desire to know their difference in howers, therfore I seeke for 94 vnder the title of distaunce of myles, and I can not find it there, for 92 and a halfe is to lyttle, and 101 ¾ is to greate.</p>

               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>And in lyke rate is there difference of minutes: for 10 minutes is to lytle, and 11 minutes is to greate. but to gesse moste nearest: as 92 and a halfe is nigher to 94 then 101 ¾: so is 10 minutes more nearer their true difference then 11. And for this time this maye suffise, althoughe I can giue you a precise rule by the part proportionable to fynde oute the iuste parte of euery minute, but that were more curious then profitable in this place: Therfore will I leaue it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you, how you may make the lyke table for any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of euen degrees.</p>

               <p>I do perceaue by these two tables, that it I haue ones the fyrst numbre which must be set against one minute of tyme, then must I double it for two minutes, and triple it for thre minutes, and so forth, styll multiplying the fyrste numbre of myles by the numbre of minutes against which it shall stende.</p>

               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>You take it well, and therfore seyng you doubte only of the fyrst numbre, I will giue you a table by whiche you may easily find out that firste numbre for all degrees of latitude of any region. And this is it. where in the first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne you see placed the degrees of latitude, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde columne are set the myles with their fractions, which serue for one degree of longitude, in eche of those dyuers latitudes. By this table may you make any table for any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of hole degrees, accordinge to the example of the former two tables.</p>

               <p>In deede bothe Orontius and other haue set forth suche tables, whiche maye suffice for an Introduction, but Orontius extendeth not his table aboue the latitude of 66. degrees and a halfe, so there resteth vnto the northe Pole 23 degrees and a halfe,<note place="margin">The famous aduenture vnto Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couia by the northe Ocean.</note> whiche coaste hytherto hath been kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to very fewe men, but nowe of late by the famous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of that woorthye companye of our Englishe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes for Moscouia, that coast is discouered vnto 75 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of latitude nighe hande: and our hope is that if they doo continue as they haue valiantlye begonne, they shall disclose those vnknowen people whiche dwell directlye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pole, or at the leaste waies discouer that climate, suche as it is, to the full satisfaction of that importune desire, whiche hathe forced manye thousandes to wisshe, that whiche not one yet (that we knowe) coulde attayne: whereby they shall not onlye profite their countrie, but shall procure to theim selues greate ryches and treasure: and that whiche is moste to bee desired, immortall same. Wherefore for my parte to further their knoweledge in the atchiuinge of their woorthye attempte, as I haue all readye in this booke giuen some lighte, so wyll I (God wyllinge) hereafter gyue more lighte: and for an earneste thereof I will nowe exhibyte to you a table of the Climates extended to the verie Pole, whereby you maye learne not onlye the beginninge and eande of euerye climate, but also the iuste quantitie of the longest and shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teste daye in eche of theim, and in all other places to the Pole selfe: the reason whereof you shall better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande by the diuersities of the ascensions.</p>
               <p>But bicause (as I saide beefore) that euerye Climate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth frome other, by the space of halfe an hower in the quantitye of their longest daye, therfore did the greekes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16115:103"/> and namely Ptolemye, for a more precisenes make a certain distinction for euery quarter of an howers difference, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he calleth only by the generall names of paralleles, as it doth at large appear in the sixte chapter of the second boke of his Almagestes, wherof at anye other tyme I will more largelye intreate. And for this present time will onlye sette forthe the summe of that matter in a table, whose firste co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumpne doth containe the numbre of the paralleles as Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemye did distincte them. The seconde columpne contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a more exacte partition of those paralleles accordinge vnto the increase of the longest daye, by a quarter of an hower, whiche Ptolemye obserued not, after hee came to is howers of lengthe: but I obserue styll, vntill 24 howers of length. after which time and place, bicause the increase of the longest daye is greater and greater continuallye, I thinke it not good to make so curious a table for euery quarter of an hower, but (as Erasmus Reynhold doth) to make the distin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction thence forthe by halfe a degree of difference in eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pole, as by the table you maye see.</p>
               <p>In this table are sette for the 96 paralleles iustlye: and but 38 by Ptolomies partition: the cause whereof, I will shewe you an other time. Of these paralleles are made 24 Climats betweene the Equinoctiall circle <hi>&amp;</hi> the Tropike of Cancer. eche differinge frome other by halfe an hower, as the laste columpne of the table declareth. but the elder Greekes dyd not knowe verye well those North cuntries, and therefore did they assigne only 7 climats according as I haue set them annexed to the firste columne of this table.</p>

Howe bee it bycause Poetes haue oftener made mention of suche rysinges, then Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers haue doone, therefore doothe Ioannes de Sacro Bosco and others also call them Ascensions Poeticall: not as fayned matters, but as thinges often remembred in Poetes bookes. And as I sayde, they putte difference betweene the rysynge of those starres in the mornyng wyth the Sonne, and the risynge of the same at the Sonne set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge. The fyrste manner of risinge with the Sonne, they call in Latine, Ortus Cosmicus, Mundanus and Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus: whiche maye well bee named in Englyshe the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge rysinge: the other sorte whiche in English ought to bee called the Euenynge risinge, is named truely in Latine ortus Vespertinus or Acronychus, and not Temporalis or Chronicus.</p>

               <p>Ignorance of the Greeke tongue hathe hindred muche manye good wittes: whiche maye often appeare not only in good Iohn de sacro bosco, but also in many writers within these 300. yeares especiallye: but wee muste wynke at suche faultes, whiche rather were the faultes of the time, then of the persons. and for this name Acronychus, is easilye tourned into Chronicus. The fyrste name is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten readde in Ptolemye and other Greeke wryters, and is named of the begynnynge of the nyghte, whiche name by ignoraunce was tourned into Chronicos in Greeke, and so accordinglye was called Temporalis in Latine, and then an ymagined reason clouted thereto: lykewaies also in the thyrde kinde of rysynge and settinge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the same author doothe make mention, hit appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that hee was somewhat deceaued, for that owghte not to bee called proprelye rysynge of anye Starre

And contrarye wayes when anye starre is so nyghe vnto the Son that the Sonne doothe take awaye or hyde the lyghte of it, it oughte to bee called the Hydynge or occultation of that starre, and not the settynge of that starre, syth settynge and rysynge haue propre relation to the Horizonte, and yet doothe hee and mennye other contrarye to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Greekes call the fyrste, the Sonnelye rysynge of the starre, and the other, the Sonnelye settyng of him where as Ptolemye and the learned Greekes call the one <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap>, and in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Occultatio, the darkenynge or hidynge of the starre. whiche chaunce happeneth commonly to any starre being within 15 degrees of the Sonne. this passion is called of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men Combustion:<note place="margin">Combustiō.

               <p>Your taking is true, for suche starres as are nigh vnto the Ecliptike line: but yet such starres as be farre from the ecliptike line, may rise or set with the Son, although thei be in an other Signe then the Sonne is, <hi>&amp;</hi> so may they ryse or set before or after <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> son, although thei be in one degre of any
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16115:107"/> Signe with the Sonne. And here maye you not forgette that the starre that setteth with the Sonne,<note place="margin">The eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning settig The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning settig</note> is named to haue an euening setting: and the starre that setteth in the weste at the Sonne rising, is iudged to haue the morning setting: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it foloweth, that the starre that hath the morning rising, hath also the euening setting: and he that hath the eueninge risinge, hath the morning setting: thus haue I spoken rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lyghtly for this time, but in the table of these risinges and settinges, you shall haue a more exacte forme of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge set out for you, touching this matter. And nowe to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tourne to those ascensions which be peculiarly called Astro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nomicall, fyrste, for the definition you muste vnderstande, that Ascension astronomicall is the certaine limitation of som pointe of the equinoctiall circle,<note place="margin">Ascentiō a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomical</note> whiche riseth iustelye with anye starre, and largely taking the vse of that name. It betokeneth also the arke of the Equinoctiall circle, whiche lyeth betweene the beginninge of the same Equinoctiall at Aries, and extendeth to the iuste degree that riseth with any starre or signe. Thirdly the ascension of a signe or constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (whiche includeth a certaine measure in lengthe,) is that iuste arke of the equinoctiall, which doth passe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont with that whole signe or constellation.</p>
               <p>This ascension is commonly dyuided into twoo kyndes, the one is called Ryghte ascension, and the other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or Crooked ascension. Ryghte ascension, is defined to bee that,<note place="margin">Ryght as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention. Croked as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention.</note> with whiche a greater portion of the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall dooth ascende. And that is called Crooked or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ascension, with whiche a lesser portion of the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall doth ascende.</p>

               <p>To the intente that I maye alleage nothinge, but that whiche shall not only be certaine and true, but also shall be manifest to you, I will firste instructe you in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of those Ascensions, and after that I will return to the proof of these my woordes. And for the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge of both definitions, I will name vnto you a thirde Ascension, which must be as the rule of those other 2, and that is the Meane ascension, for seyng you can not well refer greater and lesser but other to one common meane, or els eche to other: and I haue said before (and wil proue it anon) that they can not be compared togither,<note place="margin">The meane Ascension.</note> therfore must they bee referred and compared to one common meane, whiche I call the Mean ascension, bicause that with it ther ascendeth not so muche of the Equinoctiall, as with the right ascensiō, nor so lytle as doth ascende with the crooked ascension. and for this cause may it well be called a Mean ascension. Again it maye be called a Meane ascension, bicause it is without all excesse: for the portion of the Equinoctiall whiche ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with it, is equall to it in precisenes of degrees, so that neither of them excedeth other.</p>

               <p>It seemeth reasonable that all excesses beinge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to anye one thinge, do approue that one as a meane betwene them, namely when the excesses decline to both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, as more and fewer, greater <hi>&amp;</hi> lesser do. but in al this kinde of doctrine, the wordes are more easye to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, then the matter. Therfore excepte ye do with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

               <p>You haue learned before, that there is two varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Spheres, a Righte Sphere, and a Bowing sphere: and as in eche of these the Equinoctiall doth kepe one vniforme ascension, that is to say, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in 24 houres iustlye all the equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall doth ascende, and so consequently in euerye hower of the daye 15 degrees of the Equinoctiall doo passe the righte horizont, so the Zodiake whiche is the circle of the signes, by meanes of his obliquitie, dooth not keepe vniforme as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension anye where in any position of Sphere. for although the whole Zodiake do ascend iustly in 24 howers, yet in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hower, vnequal portions of it do ascend, and that diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the diuersities of the Climates.<note place="margin">Certain ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerall rules in a righte Sphere.</note> But in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraltye of differences, you may take these generall rules.</p>

               <p>You saye truthe, and therefore is their doctrine imperfecte, that make but two ascensions, where thre ought to be distincte, (and them selues name thre in vse, and but 2 in distinction and definition) namely seyng (as Tullye hath sayd) it is the greatest faulte that can be, to omitte any mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre in diuision: but to omitte their faultes in omission, and to retourne to their better declaration. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> This second rule do they also approoue, yea and natures ordre doth necessarily inferre the same, that euerye twoo signes or partes of Signes equall in quantitie, and lyke distaunte from anye one of the 4 principall pointes, haue equall ascensions eche to other.</p>

               <p>That is to meane, that Taurus, and Aquarius haue equall ascension, bicause they are equally distaunt from the Equinoctiall pointe of Aries.</p>

               <p>And so haue Taurus and Leo, bicause they differre equallye frome the Tropicall pointe of Cancer, and so of all the other. But to the intente that you maye the better vnderstande all this that is saide, and the reste that is to be saide, I haue here set forthe in a table the iuste num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of degrees of the Equinoctiall circle, which do answer to the degrees of euery signe in their ascensions in the right Sphere. So that if you desire to knowe the ascension of any degree of anye signe, firste seeke out the signe, and then in the firste columne looke for the noumbre of the degree, against whiche in the common corner vnderneth the Signe you may see the numbre of the degrees and Minutes of the Equinoctiall, that do ascende with that degree of the signe. And those degrees be accompted frō the beginning of the Equinoctiall at Aries, and so orderly after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> naturall course of the signes. wherby you maye perceaue, that Aries, Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus and Gemini all three togither haue for their ascension 90 degrees, whiche numbre agreeth with the quantitie of 3. signes, and therfore is their ascension Meane.

But that you maye in the mean season knowe what signes doo ascende righte, and which do ascende crokedlye in the righte sphere, you shall marke this lytle table whiche I haue drawen out of the former great ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where you see that 4 signes agree styll in their ascension, and the firste 4 haue but 27 degrees and 54 minutes of the Equinoctial answering to eche of their ascensions: the other 4 signes haue 29 degrees, 55 minutes for their ascension: and the laste 4 haue 32 degrees and 11 minutes agreeing to theyr rising, which degrees and minutes added togither, do make iuste 90 degrees that is exactlye one quarter of the equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall

               <p>And in like case I perceaue, the 6 howers of time that answereth to those whole quarters, is also the iuste quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of the naturall day, which amounteth by the addition of the three seuerall times agreing to those 3 seuerall ascensions. And as I vnderstand it, the quantitye of tyme is gathered after the rate of 15 degrees ascendinge euerye hower, as you saide before. so that euerye degree asketh 4 minutes of an hower: and 15 minutes of a degree in the Equinoctiall doo ryse in one minute of an hower: for this is alwaies to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēbred, that a minute is euer more the 60 part of that thyng whervnto it is referred. But now ther commeth to my mind the sayinge of Ioannes de Sacro Bosco, whiche longe hathe troubled my minde, and I can not learne of anye man howe to vnderstande him well: for in mine opinion his woordes import an impossibilitie. he blameth this argument as euel: These two arkes are equall, and they begin to rise togither, and continually ther riseth a greater portion of the one arke then of the other: ergo that arke will bee full risen soonest, whose greater portion did alwaies rise. This argumente see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth inuincible in mine opinion, and yet Iohn de Sacro bo sco for improuing of it alleageth an example, wherby as he seemeth to intend, the antecedent maye be true, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequente false: and therefore the argumente muste needes be naught.</p>

               <p>He willeth to take any quarter of the Zodiake, compared with his like quarter of the Equinoctiall, and to begin with that quarter from the fyrste pointe of Aries, to the latter ende of Gemini, alwaies the greater portion riseth of the Zodiake, and the lesser of the equinoctiall, and yet those two quarters ascend fully togither: and the lyke muste you vnderstande of the thirde quarter, from the beginning of Libra, to the eande of Sagittarye. but contrarye waies, in the quarter that lyeth frome the fyrste parte of Cancer, to the laste of Virgo, the portion of the Equin octiall in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fynge, is styll greater then the parte of the Zodiake that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with it: and yet those bothe arkes doo rise iustly to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the eande.</p>

               <p>Here is a greate fallation by Amphibologye, as Logitians do call it, so that in one sence it maye be true, and in an other it is false. And fyrste for declaration of Iohn his meaning (as I thinke) marke as many partes of those 2 firste quarters as you lyste, and still by the former table, as well as by tournynge the Sphere it selfe, it wyll appeare manyfestly, that the portion of the Zodiake is euer greater then the matche portion of the Equinoctiall.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That is moste true. for with 12 degrees of Aries there ascendeth of the equinoctiall 11 degrees and twoo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes only of the Equinoctiall, that is 59 minutes lesse: with 30 degrees of Aries there riseth but 27 degrees and 54 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, whiche is lesse by two degrees and syxe minutes: also in Taurus, 15 degrees hath for their ascension 42 degres and 32 minutes, that is twoo degrees and 28 minutes to lytle: the laste of Taurus ascendeth with 57 degrees and 49 minutes, whiche shoulde be 60 if it were equall with the degrees of the Zodiake. Againe the 16 degree of Gemini answereth to the ascensiō of the 74 degree and 48 minute of the equinoctial, whiche in equalitye would be 76: and the 29 degree of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini should haue by ordre of equalitie the 89 degree of the equinoctial, <hi>&amp;</hi> hath but 88 degrees <hi>&amp;</hi> 55 minuts, which is lesser

               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>This matter troubleth me to muche: for of this am I assured, that if anye two quantities be equall togyther, and a lesser portiō of the fyrste matched with a greater part of the second, then of necessitye that parte that remaineth of the fyrste quantitie, must needes be greater then that that resteth of the seconde.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>That is true also: for if you abate vnequall partes from 2 equall quantities, the portions that remaine will be vnequall, and that parte will bee leaste, frome whiche the greater portion was abated.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>As that can not be false, so it seemeth to me, that seyng there doth ascende with the whole signe of Aries but 27 degrees, and 54 minutes, there must needes remain 62 de grees and 6 minutes of that quarter, and that is more then the 60 degrees which resteth of the like quarter of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake. Now those 62 degrees and 6 minutes will ascend with the 60 degrees of the Zodiake, so that then there dooth not styll ascende a lesser portion of the Equinoctiall: for as the fyrste portion was lesser, so this seconde parte is greater.</p>

               <p>Then by the like reason, the other 6 signes Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Libra, Scorpius and Sagittarius do ascēd crokedly, bicause y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lesser portiō of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Equinoctial doth ascēd with thē: after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sort of conferēce, which is cōtrary to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> I said before, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> 4 signes only do ascend ryght in the Ryght spher:

               <p>So is it in deed. And in this greate varietie you shall marke one constaunte vniformitie, that the ascension and descension of any signe in any croked sphere ioyned by addition togither, doo make an equall summe of time with the ascension and descension of the same signe in a righte sphere, in lyke sorte ioyned togither: but to the intente that you maye vnderstande all these thinges the better, and also knowe the iuste ascension of euerye signe in this our Climat where the eleuation of the pole is 52 degrees, I haue drawen heere a speciall table for that latitude. in whiche you shall vse the like manner of entringe, as you did in the other, so that

And in eche of them are there sette in the thirde columne, the degrees of Ascension, and minutes after them, whiche appertayne to euerye signe: and in the fourthe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne are the partes of tyme, agreeynge to those partes of the Equinoctiall circle: by whiche it may appeare not onlye howe manye degrees and minutes those Signes occupye in their Ascension, but also howe manye howers or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes doo answere to the same. And in eche table is sette the full quantitie of halfe a daye, and also of halfe the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake, whiche is the full summe by addition of all the other percelles ouer them:<note place="margin">The firste rule of Ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lique Ascē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> whereby I perceaue it to bee true, that eche halfe of the Equinoctiall dooth equallye ascende wyth eche halfe of the Zodiake.</p>

               <p>Beginninge the halues of them bothe at the Equinoctiall pointes, in Aries and Libra, it is most true: but not so yf you begin at the Tropike pointes, or in anye other partes of theym: for yf you begynne at anye of the northerlye Signes betweene Aries and Libra, and so recken 6 signes togyther, those Sygnes shall haue a ryghte Ascension: for wyth them shall ascende a greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Equinoctiall. But if you doo recken syxe Signes and begynne that accompte betweene Libra and Aries, in the southe parte of the Zodiake, then doo those syxe signes ascende crookedlye: for as muche as the portion of the Equinoctiall that ryseth with them, is lesse then halfe of it.</p>

               <p>I take an example out of the table of 50 degrees of latitude, and for the fyrste fyue Signes I sette the quantities of their ascensions, as heere is seene, <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">

               <p>For tryall of this rule I haue sette forth here a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contayninge all the diuersities (though not all the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of latitude) that happen in anye Climate vnder 67 degrees of latitude, that is vnto the Polare circle. So that by thys table you maye examine all the rules bothe of Iohn de Sacro Bosco, and also of others. Nowe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine those arkes that followe Aries, and so abate their ascensions, as your rule saythe, frome Aries, vnto the eande of Virgo.</p>

               <p>Firste for Aries it selfe: I see that it abateth in this table from 27 degrees and 54 minutes vnto nothinge. And Taurus abateth also frome 29 degrees and 54 minutes vnto nothinge. Lykewise Gemini abateth from 32 degrees and 12 minutes vnto nothinge. But contrary waies, Cancer, Leo, and Virgo, do not abate, but increase the quantities of their Ascensions. so that in the three firste Signes onlye (that is Aries, Taurus and Gemini) that rule is true, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Signes, Cancer, Leo and Virgo, it appeareth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to be false.</p>

               <p>Yet in one manner of consideration those words maye be true as he hath spoken them, though not so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as the woordes do sound: for it appeareth that your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth accompt the beginning of those arkes (whereof he speaketh) not from diuers and seuerall pointes, but from one common beginning, which is the fyrst degree of Aries, and in that sence his rule is true. for proofe whereof here is two other tables sette forthe, in whiche is declared the quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tities of the Ascensions of the twelue Signes, but not in such sorte as it was in the table nexte before, for there euerye arke of the seuerall Signes did take his beginninge at the fyrste degree of the same Signe. but in these twoo tables the arke of ascension is accompted from the fyrst degree of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as from the common beginning, and eandeth at the laste degree of euery seuerall Signe. And now by this fyrst table if you examine <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> former rule you shal find it to be true

And in the seconde signification, the ascension of Aries whole signe is that whole ark of 13 degrees and 52 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and so the whole arke from the beginning of Aries, to the eande of Taurus, hathe for his ascension that whole arke of 31 degrees, and 47 minutes of the Equinoctiall. And in this signification dooth Iohn de sacro Bosco vse the name of Ascension, and in this sense his rules be true: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to whiche sense I haue drawen to you certaine tables: the firste for the ascensions of the twelue Signes in the right Sphere: the second, for the ascension of the Signes in 52 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of latitude: the thirde and fourthe are these twoo tables last before, which for diuers latitudes doo declare the quantities of the Ascensions of al arkes of whole signes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted from the beginning of Aries. The thyrde signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ascensions is the quantitie of that arke of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noctiall whiche ascendeth with anye certaine arke of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diake: as for example. that arke of the equinoctiall that ascē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with any signe seuerally taken, is called the ascension of that signe.

And in this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification must it be vnderstande, when it is sayde that any signe hath a Right ascension or an Oblique ascension, for if the arke of the Equinoctiall that riseth with that signe, bee greater then 30 degrees,<note place="margin">A Ryghte ascension.</note> then hathe that signe a Righte ascension: and if the arke of the Equinoctiall be lesser then 30 degres, then is that ascension called an Oblique ascension:<note place="margin">An Oblique ascension.

               <p>It appeareth so in deed. for Libra increaseth from 207 degrees and 54 minutes, vnto 235 degres <hi>&amp;</hi> 48 minutes. And Scorpio frō 237 degrees <hi>&amp;</hi> 48 minuts, vnto 295 degres
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16115:124"/> and 36 minutes. likwaies Sagittarius from 270 degrees vnto 360 degrees. So dooth it appeare, that Libra dooth increase betweene the Equinoctiall and the Polare circle, 27 degres, and 54 minutes. And Scorpio increaseth 57 degrees and 50 minutes. Also Sagittarius augmenteth by 90 degrees. And now contrarye waies, Aries doth a bate from 27 degres and 54 minutes to nothinge. Taurus diminisheth frome 57 degrees and 48 minutes vnto nothinge also.

               <p>In anye of those twoo which be referred to arkes: for the fyrste can haue no place here, bicause it signifeth the ascension of one pointe only, and not of any arke as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twoo do, and as this rule doth importe.</p>

               <p>Then may I proue by examples in both sortes of tables. And firste to beginne with those tables that accompt the whole arkes from the beginning of Aries, I fynd the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of Aries in the head of the table, <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

Now to proue <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> like in an Oblique Sphere, I take the latitude of 40 degrees.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16115:124"/> and there I fynde for Aries his ascension is degrees and 4 minutes: and for Libra I fynde in the seconde table 217 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 44 minutes: <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">

Also in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letration of 60 degrees I trye the like, where Aries hath 7 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 16 minutes, and Libra hath 228 degrees and 32 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, which by additiō amount to the same sum as before. <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">

               <p>I take the arke of Aries ascension as before 27 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 54 minutes: and the ascension of Libra (accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng only the arke of it from his owne beginninge) in lyke sorte 27 degrees and 54 minutes. so that both ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make 55 degrees and 48 minutes. <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">

               <p>I take fyrste the arke from the beginning of Leo, to the eande of the same Signe, and fynd it to bee 29 degrees and 54 minutes in the ryght sphere: and so for the Ascensiō of the Signe of Aquarius, beyng equall to it, and agaynste it in the Zodiake, I fynde the lyke noumbre, whiche make by addition 59 degrees and 48 minutes. <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

               <p>This rule is partly a greeable with the laste rule, and partly seuerall, in as muche as euery contrarye arke is lyke distaunte frome the one Equinoctiall pointe, as the fyrste arke is frome the other Equinoctiall pointe. thys rule dooth agree (after a sorte thoughe not proprely) wyth the other laste before: but consideringe that Aries and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sces as whole signes haue lyke arkes, and are equallye dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt from one Equinoctiall pointe, thoughe in backe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre: for the eande of Aries is iuste equall in distaunce from the precise Equinoctioll pointe, as the beginninge of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sces is from the same. And in this pointe these Signes haue thys seuenth rule as a speciall rule for theym and their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censions.

               <p>As this figure doth teache me what signes may be conferred togither, so the tables before written doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the quantities of their ascensions in those seueral latitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des: and the true meaning of bothe those rules, as well as of other, touchinge ascensions.</p>

               <p>That muste needes follow ordrely: for if Aries bee equall in ascension with Pisces, and Taurus equall in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe with Aquarius, then ioyntly Aries and Taurus must needes be of one quantitie in ascension with Aquarius and Pisces, by composition of proportions, as is taughte in Geometrye and Arithmetike also.</p>

               <p>Lykewaise (by resolution of propositions) if al Aries be like in ascension with all Pisces, then the first degre of Aries shall ascende equallye with the laste degree of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sces: and the 20 degree of Aries, wyth the 10 degree of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sces: <hi>&amp;</hi> in lyke manner of eche other degree equally distaunte from the Equinoctiall pointes: and so lykewaies of euerye minute: for these rules of equalitie or inequalitie of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censions of arkes, doo serue as well for the arkes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and mynutes, as for the arkes of whole Signes, or of greater quantities. Also this rule is general, that all arkes that ascende rightly, do descende crookedly, be they great or small: and contrarye wayes, what arke so euer ascendeth crookedlye, doth descende righte: whereby it commeth to passe, that alwaies the one signe counteruailyng with his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary, there is euermore one halfe of the Zodiake aboue the Horizonte, as well as there is one halfe of the Equinoctiall aboue the same. so that when so euer anye degree of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake doth set in the weste, the contrarye degree dooth rise in the easte. Of this it foloweth, that in the longeste daye in the yeare there dooth rise but syxe Sygnes, and in the

               <p>I were to grosse headded if I wold make a doubt thereof. And bycause I will declare vnto you how I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the vse of it, I wyll by an example or twoo make it appeare. When the Artificiall daye is 14 howers longe, and 20 minutes, and the nyghte then is 9 howers longe and 40 minutes of necessitye: I woulde knowe the iuste quantitye of the howers vnequall. Firste therefore, in the fyrste co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomne I seeke oute the numbre of the howers, whiche is 14, then in the highest raunge of numbres I seeke the odde minutes, beinge 20, and bicause I fynde no suche numbre there, I take the nexte numbre whiche is 24, and by those 2 numbres in their common angle againste 14 towarde the righte hande, directly vnder the 24 minutes, I fynde 1, 12, whereby I vnderstande, that eche vnequall hower is longer then the equall hower by 12 minutes that daye. and for the nyghte I fynde againste 9 and vnder the numbre of 36 (whiche is nexte vnto 40) the iuste quantitie of eche vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualle hower of the same nighte, to bee 0, 48, that is but 48 minutes: and so is the vnequall hower of the nyghte lesser by twelue minutes, then is the equalle hower. And so bothe those howers ioyned togither, doo make twoo howers, equall to twoo Equinoctiall or Equall howers. for so muche as the one is to lyttle, the other is to greate. Againe for an other triall, I take the artificiall daye to bee 8 howers and 36 minutes long, and therfore to know the quan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titie of an vnequall hower, I seeke against 8, and vndernethe 36, wher I fynd 0, 43, which giueth me to vnderstand that the vnequall hower that daye is only 43 minutes in quantity, <hi>&amp;</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:16115:128"/> the nyghte then beynge 15 howers long and 24 minutes, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his vnequall howers of 1 hower and 17 minutes longe: whereby it is seene also, that so muche is supplied by the one hower as was wantinge in the other. so that euermore one vnequall hower of the day ioined with an vnequal hower of the nyghte, will make two howers equall to two equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all howers.</p>

And against those signes and degrees ar set the quantities of euery hower in the daye for that time, when the Sonne is in any suche degree of those signes.

               <p>I doo perceaue it to bee reasonable, that the first hower of the daye muste be accompted that hower, in whose beginning the Sonne doth rise: so that euery daye the fyrste hower is begonne with the ascension of that degree of anye signe wherein the sonne is. And the first hower of the night is begonne with the ascension of that degree, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite or contrary to the place of the sonne: whiche place is commonly called in latine Nadir Solis, althoughe in deede the one woorde is an Arabike woorde, and not latine. And after that firste hower as the other howers of necessitye doo follow in ordre of numbre, so their distinction in quantitie doth follow in this table: and the difference of them is agre able to the diuersitye of the ascension of eche halfe signe of the Zodiake, as they doo followe in ordre.<note place="margin">Exaumple.</note> So that to come to an example, for declaration that I doo vnderstande that table. yf I woulde knowe the quantitie of the vnequall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, when the sonne is in Aries and in his fyrste degree, I must entre the fyrste parte of the table, where I fynde on the lefte hande the Signes and their degrees: wherefore againste Aries and <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>

Then for the nighte the howers appeare in the other parte of the table, where the firste hower dooth containe one equall or common hower, and 26 minutes: the seconde hower and the third be of lyke quantitie, and so do they afterwarde decrease vntyll the laste hower of the nyght. An other example:<note place="margin">Exaumple.</note> when the son is in the 10 degree of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, bicause I can not fynde that degree in the table, I take the degree nexte vnto it, whiche is the 12 degree, and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge with it, I fynde the fyrste vnequall hower to containe 1. equall hower, and 19 minutes: and the second vnequall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer hath in it 1. equall hower and 24 minutes. Nowe for the nyghte I looke in the seconde parte of the table, and fynde the fyrste vnequall hower to bee but 49 minutes in lengthe, and the seconde but 39 minutes. and so in ordre folowinge. This muste I doo when the Sonne is in anye of the northe signes, but if the son be in any of the south signes, thē must we accompt the day howers in the second part of the table, <hi>&amp;</hi> the howers of the night must be sought in the firste parte of the table: in all other pointes I perceaue there is small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

               <p>You are to farre deceiued, and therefore I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt your woordes, for all thinges are to bee gouerned by reason. So that if the howers do increase in quantitie, then is it reasonable to adde the parte proportionable to the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser numbre of tyme, as it was in the former example: but in this example you see the time dooth not increase, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, (seynge the tyme against 6 degrees is greater then the tyme against 12 degrees) and therefore by good reason the parte proportionable is to be abated from the greater, and not to be added to the lesser.</p>

               <p>So is it reasonable: therfore must I take that 5 ⅓ from 47, <hi>&amp;</hi> then resteth 41 2/3, whiche is the precise quantitie of that vnequall hower. And nowe I thanke you, I am fully instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted touching that matter: so that for anye vnequall hower accordinge to the place of the sonne in this latter table, and after the lengthe of the daye in the fyrste table, I canne fynde oute the quantitie of eche vnequalle hower: but these twoo formes doo not make exactly one quantitye of howers vnequall.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>This I perceaue well inoughe: and farther also, that the Naturall daies are euer 24 howers longe, in all our knowen cuntries, but the Artificiall daies do increase and de crease diuerfely. And as I desire to know the causes therof, so I do meruail how it cometh to passe, that in any cuntry or cli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mat the naturall daies shuld differ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>To the intente that we may proceede ordrely, we wyll begin with the one forte of daies, and so come to the talke of the other. And firste as concerning Naturall dayes, I sayde that they were cōmonly accompted from son rysing to son setting: which descriptiō being true, what shal we say
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16115:131"/> of those northe and southe cuntries, where the Sonne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth aboue the Horizont in some places three weekes, in other 6 weeks, and so increasing tyll it extend to halfe a year. in al which places if we call the naturall day <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> space from son risyng to Sonne risyng again, then can not the naturall day be of one quantitie to all nations, and so shuld those daies naturall differ in nature, whiche were agaynste nature vtter lye: and therefore dyd I vse that woorde commonlye in the former description: but if I shall define the naturall daye exactlye, I muste call it that iuste tyme in whiche the eight Sphere or Firmamente dooth exactlye accomplyshe his course,<note place="margin">The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall daye.</note> whiche tyme of naturall daye is the common mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure of all other tymes: and thys tyme is alwayes equalle in all places, howe be it accordynge to the former descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, yf the retournynge of the Sonne bee accompted frome anye one parte of the Meridiane lyne, to the same parte of the sayde lyne, then maye that description well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to all partes of the worlde: for althoughe some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue the Sonne in syghte halfe a yeare togither, yet dooth the sonne retourne to theyr meridiane lyne towarde the southe, at the eand of 24 howers within a little, and in all places lykewaies where the daye it not full 24 howers, the sonne doothe retourne to their horizont, at the eand of 24 howers nygh hande.</p>

               <p>I heare you speake in bothe these declarations, with a doubtfull limitation of the 24 howers, as thoughe that tyme were not the precise or iuste measure of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall daye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>So shall it appeare vnto you, yf you consider that the sonne dooth euerye daye runne one degree almoste towarde the easte, accordynge to the succession of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes, as before is mentioned: for if this daye the sonne be in the fyrste degree of Libra iustely at noone, then to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe at noone hee wyll bee in the seconde degree: and so
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16115:132"/> the thirde daye hence in the thirde degree: and by the same reason at the monethes eande, wyll the sonne haue passed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra cleerely, and bee in the beginninge of the nexte signe, whiche is Scorpius: and therefore must he be slacker in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming to the Meridian line, by so muche time as serueth for the risynge of all the signe of Libra in a Righte sphere.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>That tyme must be an hower and 52 minutes. for (as I remembre) the partes of the Equinoctiall whiche doo serue for the ascension of Libra, are 27 degrees and 54 minutes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>As that is true, so marke what is the difference now for euerye day of that moneth,<note place="margin">The firste cause of di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersitye in Naturall dayes.</note> and then shall you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the difference of the Naturall dayes, as muche as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of that cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>For the fyrste degree of Libra, the quantitye of his ascention is 55 minutes of the equinoctiall, whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in time of an hower 3 minutes and ⅔, and so maye I see for diuers degrees at the beginninge of Libra, by the table of the astensions in the Right sphere: but towarde the eande of the same signe, I see 57 minutes agreeyng to the ascension of one degree, whiche maketh some difference in tyme also, thoughe it bee small.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Marke now about the middle of Scorpius, how eche degree of the Zodiake hath one degree of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall agreeynge to his ascension, whiche maketh in tyme 4 minutes of an hower: and about the mydle of Sagittarius one degree of the Zodiake hathe aunswerable to him 64 or 65 minutes of the Equinoctiall. and so in other diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Signes shall you fynd diuers quantities of their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censions, whereby it must needes appeare, that if the Sonne dyd moue forwarde in the Zodiake euery daye one degree iustlye, that the sonne shoulde be 4 minutes after the 24 ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers slacker then he was the daye before in touching the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiane line, if there were not an other cause of diuersitye by the sundrye quantities of the ascensions.</p>
            </sp>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:16115:132"/>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>This cause is manifest. And bicause I see for some degrees of the Zodiake but onlye 55 minutes of the Equinoctiall, whiche maketh in time 3 minutes and ⅔: and for other degrees 65 minutes, whiche is 4 minutes and 1/3;: so doth it appeare that the greatest difference is but 2/3 partes of a minute: whiche is a small matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Yet this small matter will cause muche matter in Astronomicall computations, though there were no more difference of diuersitie in Naturall dayes but this only: but yet are there twoo other causes in all Oblique spheres, and but one in the Right sphere. The seconde common cause in bothe spheres, is the eccentricitye of the Sonne.<note place="margin">The second cause of vn equal daies naturall.</note>

Nowe maye you see that eche cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is diuided into 4 quarters: and lykewise you may se, that the higher halfe of the lesser circle doth not fully answere to halfe the greater circle: and againe the nether halfe of the lesser circle doth occupy more then the halfe of the greater circle. whereby it muste needes bee euidente to all men, that when the Sonne moueth in the higher part of his eccentrike circle, hee doth moue slowlyer then he dooth in the nether parte of the same eccentrike: I meane in comparison to the Zodiake of the eyghte sphere: and thereby must it appeare that the Sonne doth not euerye daye moue lyke numbre of minutes in the Zodiake: and you maye easilye coniecture hereby, that this is an other cause of diuersitye in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titye of the naturall dayes.<note place="margin">The thirde cause of diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of daies Naturall.</note> A thyrde diuersitye is that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is peculiare to euerye seuerall climate, and not common to anye two on one syde of the Equinoctiall, and that is the obliquitie of the Horizonte, yf the daye shall bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from sonne risynge to sonne risynge againe: but this varietie is so greate and so diuers, that it is in manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite: and therfore doo Astronomers reiecte the ordre of accompt of daies, and recken the day from noone to none, whiche accompte serueth generally for all the partes of the worlde, as if all Climates had one Horizont: for as in the ryghte sphere bothe the Poles doo touche the Horizont, so the meridianes of euery climate and of all regions do passe by bothe the Poles of the worlde: and therefore all ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accompted vnto that meridiane line, must bee estemed as ryghte ascensions, I meane ascensions lyke vnto them that be in the righte sphere.</p>

               <p>Nowe do I perceaue, that although there may be assigned thre causes of varietie in the naturall dayes, yet one of them whiche is gathered by the obliquitie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rizonte in not regarded of Astronomers, sith they doo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the beginning of the daye from <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>

The thirde cause whiche dependeth of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of the ascensions by obliquitye of the Horizonte, is peculiare to this treatise, and maye be gathered oute of the tables of ascensions whiche serue for the Ryghte sphere: of all whiche varieties at a time of more conuenient leasure, I will make for mine exercise a table at large. but in the meane ceason I praye you, proceede as you haue begonne.</p>

               <p>Touching the diuersities of Naturall dayes this maye suffice: and for a common and meane quantitie you maye assigne 24 howers and 4 minutes, bicause that is the common nombre: for althoughe many be greater, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other bee lesser. and this numbre is moste nyghest the meane.<note place="margin">The diuersi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of the artificiall daies.</note> Nowe touching Artificiall daies you shall fynde no fewer diuersities: wherein although all the former three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be concurrent, yet the principall cause is the obliquitie of the Horizont. And althoughe I haue twyse before made mention of those daies, yet doth there rest more to be sayd of them. for in bothe places before I dyd briefly touche the causes of diuersitie of suche Artificialle daies in diuers cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and in the table of the distinction of climates, I dyd sette forth the quantitie of the longest daye in eche of them: and nowe will I shew you somwhat of the reason of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie in anye one climate. Fyrst therfore to begin withal, you knowe that before the sonne in his naturall course can passe the full of one degre, he is caried by the violence of the Starrye skye rounde aboute the earthe. so that in going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the firste degree of Capricorne, and the fyrste of Cancer, he dooth consume halfe a yeare, and therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth aboue is 2 reuolutions lyke spirall circles, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerslye parted by the Horizont, accordyng to the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the eleuation of the Pole. As in the Ryght sphere they are all parted by the Horizont into two equall partes:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16115:134"/> so in euerye bowing Sphere, they are vnequally deuided by the Horizont, so that where the north pole is eleuate aboue the Horizont, there those circles of the sonnes reuolutions which be from the equinoctiall northward, haue the greater portion aboue the horizont, and the lesser parte vnder the same: and contrarye waies those circles (or spires if you like better so to call them) whiche be from the Equinoctiall to the tropike of Capricorne, and serue for explication of the Sonnes motion, they haue their greater portion vnder the Horizont, and the lesser portion aboue the same. And com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paringe eche one of these to other, that circle whiche is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest towarde the south, is moste parte vnder the Horizont of anye other. and euerye one of them the more it depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the south and draweth toward the north, the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter is his portion that is aboue the horizonte, and the lesser is that other portion whiche is vnder the same. wherfore the middlemost bounde of those two extremes, is iuste halfe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der, and halfe aboue the Horizonte: and therfore the sonne beyng in it, doth make his abode iuste lyke tyme aboue the earthe, as he doth vnder it, and therby the daies and nights are equall: but from thence towarde Cancer, the daye dooth still increase aboue the nighte: and from thence toward Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne, the daye dothe still abate shorter then the nyghte: which thinge will easilye appeare to the sight, bothe by these
<figure>
                     <figDesc>Geometric diagram.</figDesc>
                  </figure> figures here drawen, and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so by the diuers positions of the materiall Sphere or globe. And styll the higher that the Pole is eleuate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Horizōt, the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter parte of the northerlye circles is aboue the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zont, and the lesser parte of theym vnder the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonte. And contrary waies
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16115:134"/> of the southerlye circles, the greater portions of them are vnder the horizont, and the lesser portions aboue it. Nowe is it easily perceaued, that seynge the sonne dooth kepe hys dailye course in one of those circles, then accorginglye as that circle in whiche the sonne doth moue, is parted by the horizonte, so is the partition of the 24 howers into daye and nyghte agreeablye: so that if the circle of the sonnes course be more vnder the horizont then aboue it, then shall the nyghte be longer then the daye: and if the greater parte of the sonnes circle be aboue the horizont, then the day shal exceede the nighte, in lyke proportion as the partes of the circles are in comparison togither.</p>

               <p>These diuers circles (I perceaue) are not in the sphere of the sonne, but are accompted in the eighte sphere betweene the two tropikes, so that euery daye by the reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Firmament, the sonne is caried frome easte to weste rounde about the earthe, and by this violente motion doth describe a spirall circle (as you call it) and not an exact circle: but yet maye it serue in this case, as if it were a iuste circle: the difference is so lytle of the space betweene the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lynes in comparison to their compasse, whiche by the table of declination before expressed, I gesse to bee in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion scarse 1/1000, which is no part notable in this case. And this farther I note: that two circles on contrary partes of the Equinoctiall equally distaunt from it, are parted by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizont after one rate, and into lyke portions: but yet in such difference, that the parte of the one circle aboue ground, is equall to the parte of the other that is vnder ground: and so contrary waies. wherby it foloweth, that the day of the one is equall to the nyghte of the other, and so contrarye wayes also. Again seeyng that the sonne dothe descend from Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer vnto Capricorne, by the same circles of reuolution, by whiche he dydde ascende from Capricorne vnto Cancer, it must needes follow that euery two dayes in the yeare equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distaunte from the longest daye, or from the shortest, are
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16115:135"/> equall in their artificiall daye, and in their nighte. These ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall thinges I maye easilye gather: but howe I maye knowe iustlye the quantitye of euerye Artificiall daye from other, and the precise tyme of the sonne risinge and setting, I canne not so easilye gather. wherefore if it please you in those two pointes I desyre your instruction.</p>

               <p>This is a table of to much ease, and therfore doth ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther teache negligence, then anye thinge els. for him that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth to excercise his witte in readines of accompte, it is an easy matter to tourne degrees into howers without anye tables, and therefore such tables myght well bespared, &amp; yet
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16115:136"/> manye bokes are full of them: but if you lysted, you might haue abbridged it more frome 15 vpwarde, takinge onlye euen 15 styll. as thus. 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, &amp;c. so seemeth all the reste superfluous, excepte your numbre of degrees in the daye arke, happen iuste agreeable with some one of those in the table: but nowe to procede, giue one example for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your vnderstandinge herein.</p>

               <p>Then to begin I sette the globe to the eleuation of 52 degrees,<note place="margin">Exaumple.</note> and considre the place of the sonne the 14 day of Auguste, and fynde it to be by the Ephemerides, in the fyrst beginning of Virgo, therefore do I set the beginning of Virgo in the verye horizont, and then do I see with it the 137 degree of the Equinoctiall in the same Horizont, whiche I doo marke: afterwarde I tourne the sphere tyll the place of the sonne be in the Horizont on the west part, and then in the easte parte I marke the degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, whyche is 347 degrees. <gap reason="math" resp="#oxf">

                  </gap>Nowe abatinge 137 oute of 347, there resteth the whole daye arke, whiche is 210 degrees, whiche make 14 howers, as by the former table is easily seene. wherfore I conclude that the 14 daye of August, the sonne shineth 14 howers, and then muste the nighte be but euen 10 howers, sith bothe times make iust 24 howers: but yet I see not howe to knowe the howers of the sonne rysinge, and settinge.</p>

               <p>I am sure you thinke that the Noone is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the daye, and that the sonne shyneth lyke space bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noone and after noone.</p>

               <p>Then partinge the whole time of the sonne shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or of the artificial day into 2 equal parts, the one halfe doth limite the hower after none at which the son doth set.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That is in this exaumple 7, and so muste it needes be. And now I see by the same reason, the sonne must ryse 7 howers before noone, that is at 5 of the clocke in the mornynge.</p>

               <p>So is it. And for that eande that you maye haue a generall rule therein, euermore abate halfe the quantity of the daye from 12 howers, and then will the remainer declare the iuste hower and minute of the sonne risynge.</p>

                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>so that the sonne risynge appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be twelue minutes after 4. of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge. And nowe I thinke my selfe conninge inoughe in all this matter.</p>

               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Yet for more ease: after that you haue noted the degree of the Equinoctiall that dooth rise with the place of the son, you may marke the degree that riseth with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye point against the son: and abate then the fyrst oute of the second, and so accomplish your woorke, as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. for it is all one thinge, but that you need not to loke in cōtrary sides of your sphere for your worke. And this shall you note farther: that if the first ascension of the place of the son be greater then the second ascension of the Nadir of the son, you shal put to the second ascension, 360 degrees,<note place="margin">A <hi>Cautele.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>&amp;</hi> then abate as you are taught before. As for example: the first day of February the son is by the Ephemerides in the 22 degree<note place="margin">Exaumple.</note> of February the son is by the Ephemerides in the 22 degree<note place="margin">Exaumple.</note>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:16115:137"/> of Aquarius, that degree I find in the Zodiak of my spher, and I sette it iuste in the easte parte of the Horizonte, and ther may I se that the 343⅓ degree of the Equinoctiall doth ascend at the same instant in the Horizont also: which I must accompt for the true ascentiō of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> degre of Aquarius. Then tourne I to the 22 degree of Leo, beinge the Nadir of the sonne, and with it when it is sette in the Horizonte, I marke the 125⅓ degree of the Equinoctiall to ascende. Nowe when I woulde subtracte 343⅓ out of 125⅓, it will not be: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put vnto the lesser numbre 360, and so it amounteth to 485¾, and then from it I abate 343⅓, and there remaineth 142 5/12: whiche if you chaunge into partes of time, do make 9 howers and 30 minutes: and that is the quantitie of the fyrste daye of Februarye.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Scholar.</speaker>
               <p>The halfe of that is 4 howers, and 45 minutes, whereby I knowe, that at the 45 minute that is ¾ of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer after 4 of the clocke the sonne setteth: and riseth in the mornynge 15 minutes, that is ¼ of an hower after 7 of the clocke.

               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>Seeyng wee intende to abate the fyrste ascension oute of the seconde, to thintente that their distaunce maye bee knowen, seeynge the whole compasse of the circle is but 360, from whiche if you abate the fyrste ascension being the greatest numbre, then wyll there remaine the distaunce betwene y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ascention <hi>&amp;</hi> the end of the equinoctial: vnto which differēce you must adde so many degres as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> secōd ascentiō requireth, as both reason <hi>&amp;</hi> practise wil declare vnto any mā.</p>

And bicause at other 2 times in the year the nights ar equall to those daies, therfore on the right hād of the table are ther 2 columnes of moneths, and other two columnes of signes agreeable therto, in which those nights are equall with the daies of the monethes on the lefte hand, and therfore ar the title set ouer the signes <hi>&amp;</hi> moneths on the lefte hand, signes for the day: and on the right hande signes for the nighte: that is to saye, that if the moneth and signe for which you seke, be on the left side of the table, then do the numbres vnder the eleuation of the Pole declare the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the day: but if the monethes <hi>&amp;</hi> signes be on the right side, then is that quantitie the length of the night. and ouer the 5 midle pillers, you se the title to be the Eleuation of the Pole, or latitude of regions; whiche are there but only 5 ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely set, namely 51, 52, 53, 54, <hi>&amp;</hi> 55: whiche may serue for all Englād, from the south sea vnto Scotlād. And so may it do for diuerse of the northe partes of Europe and Asia. Nowe for the vse of them, this is the ordre. When so euer you wold know the quantitie of the daye Artificiall and of his night, seeke out the day in the columnes on the right hande, or on the lefte hand as it will chaunce, and by it in the next column you may see the place of the Son in the Zodiake: then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng right forth towarde the middle of your table tyll you come directly vnder the column that serueth for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in latitude, there shall you finde 2 numbres: the first be tokening howers, and the second minutes of howers, which declare the iuste quantitie of the day for the moneths on the lefte hande: or els if the moneth that you seeke for be on the right hand, then do those numbres of howers and minutes betoken the quantitie of the nyghte.</p>

               <p>I perceaue it well, and I se by reason it must nedes
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16115:139"/> be so: as for examples sake. the 24 daye of Auguste I desire to knowe the lengthe of the day and the place of the Sonne in the Zodiake: wherfore fyndynge the saide 24 daye in the fyrste table of those thre ryght against it, I may see the place of the sonne, whiche is then the 11 degree of Virgo: and from thence proceedinge forth righte towarde the myddle of the table, I fynde vnder the numbre of 52 degrees of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 13 howers and 18 minutes: whereby I perceaue that the Artificiall daye from sonne rysynge to sonne settinge, is so longe with vs: and the nyght is the reste of 24 howers, that is 10 howers and 42 minutes. And the lyke quantities of daye and nyght must needes be the 29 daye of marche, when the sonne is in the 19 degree of Aries. But on the 20 daye of February, the sonne beyng in the 11 degree of Pisces, that 13 howers and 18 minutes is the quantitie of the nyghte, and the day then is but 10 howers and 42 minutes in length: and so likewaies the seconde daye of Octobre, when the sonne is in the 19 degree of Libra.</p>

               <p>This is sufficiente: for as you haue doone in this so maye you doo in all other lyke. yet for the more certenty I will proue you with one question more: For London whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is supposed to be 51 degrees and 24 minutes in latitude, I woulde knowe the quantitie of the daye Artificialle when the sonne is in the 28 degree of Scorpio.</p>

               <p>I fynde that signe of Scorpio in the second table on the right hand, and the 10 daye of Nouembre answering vnto it. And bicause 24 minutes are lesse then halfe a degre, I do seeke the quantitie of the daye vnder 51 degrees rather then vnder 52, and so fynde I 15 howers and 30 minutes: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in this case is the quantitie of the nyghte, as the title de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that is ouer those signes: therfore the lengthe of the daye is 8 howers and 30 minutes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A cautele for the part proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>You haue done well. But yet for an exacter precisenes, you may take the part proportionable for the odde minuts of the eleuation, as thus. for the latitude of 51 degrees, the

               <p>That is (by the second table) the 15 daye of Iuly, and then is the daye in lengthe 15 howers and 30 minutes, in the latitude of 51 degrees: but in the latitude of 52 degrees, it is 15 howers and 40 minutes, so it increaseth 10 minutes: and therfore muste I adde the parte proportionable (which is 4 minutes as before) vnto 30. and so haue I the true quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie 34 minutes aboue 15 howers.

               <p>It were to longe a woorke to sette out all diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eleuations, and scarse agreeable for this treatise, wher these thinges are but incidente, and not principall matters. but at other times in more conuenient place it shall be done if I maye vnderstande this my labour to be profitably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. And thē also will I make explicatiō of dyuers other matters, whiche you did in your table at the beginning of this treatise propounde, although at this time I thinke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them lytle appertaining to this booke. But yet before I eande this treatise, I must speak somwhat of twoo or three matters more:<note place="margin">Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> And firste of the chieffe Constellations and figures in the Starry skye. For a ground you shall note, that the starres are not only in multitude infinite, but many of them also so smal, that scarse any mans eye can discern them.

               <p>I knowe it ryghte well. but yet I thoughte good to admonish you in that matter, least at any time you shuld fynde the doubte, when you shall haue no opportunity to aske councell therein: but now to proceede. before the eand of the same moneth of Septembre, the sayde Planete wyll be cleane hydde with the sonne beames: for within 2 dayes after (I meane the second daye of Octobre) she doth ioyne with the sonne by coniunction. And frome that daye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the sonne doth outgo hir so faste, that by the 13 daye of Octobre, she wyll be out of his beames againe, and ryse almoste an hower and a quarter before the sonne. and at the eande of Nouembre, she will be 46 degrees behind the sonne, in ordre of the signes, and yet shall she rise 4 howers and more before the sonne, where as the numbre of degrees are equall to lyttle more then three howers. but the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the Horizont, doth make all the diuersitie in this, excepte a meane trifle by the latitude of Venus. And thus
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16115:146"/> may you marke Venus in all that moneth, and in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre also vnto the eande of the yeare: but then dooth she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate her distaunce againe, wherby it is easye to vnderstande that she hathe a seuerall motion from the sonne, and a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sphere also.</p>

               <p>Yea in deede, for three of them which bee moste highest, if you lyste to learne to knowe them, and to marke their courses: but Mercury is not so well marked, bicause he doth alwaies keepe his course nigh about the sonne,<note place="margin">Mercury.</note> and therfore his obseruation requireth greate diligence, and his courses appeare most straunge, yet bothe he and Venus do accomplishe their course in a yeare with the sonne:<note place="margin">Saturne.</note> but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne is so slacke a mouer, that you shall not well perceaue his motion vnder 4 moneths. in which time he doth moue about 4 degrees: so that if you marke his place at any time, and within 4 monthes after that time yf you do marke him againe, you shall perceaue that hee is gone 4 degrees east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, whiche you maye marke by the fixed starres aboute that place: but if you doo after a whole yeare marke hys place, then shall you perceaue well and manifestly, that hee is gone eastwarde 12 degrees, and somwhat more: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The fyrste daye of Septembre, the laste yeare 1555, Saturne was in the 12 degree of Aries, and this year of 1556 we see him to be in the 26 degree of the same signe, wherby it dothe appeare, that he hathe moued 14 degrees eastwarde in that yeare space. And if you will haue farther proofe: In the yeare of our Lorde 1549, the laste daye of Nouembre, Saturne was seene in the 26 degree of Capricorne, and this yeare of 1556 the fyrste of Septembre, the same starre was in the 26 degree of Aries: wherby it maye bee knowen that hee hath moued three whole signes (whiche is a quarter of the Zodiake) in 7 year space. And so in lesse then 30 yeares,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16115:147"/> hee dothe go about the whole Zodiake.</p>
               <p>Iupiter hath a swyfter course, for he passeth the circuite of heauen in lesse then 12 yeares.<note place="margin">Iupiter.</note> so doth he euery yeare run ouer one signe, and euery two moneths he passeth 5 degres.</p>
               <p>Mars is yet swyfter in course then hee, and compasseth all the Zodiake in 2 yeare,<note place="margin">Mars.</note> and euery moneth passeth halfe a signe. wherby for this point, he is more easy to be marked, then anye of the other. but yet are his motions difficulte to marke in other pointes: but this may suffice for tryall that he moueth eastwarde, as all the other Planetes do: and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore must he be iudged, as all the other also oughte to haue seuerall spheres in whiche they moue. And although theyr spheres can not bee seene, yet in as muche as their starres maye be so well perceaued, it muste needes follow, that they haue spheres also: except we shuld come to that absurditie to saye, that they moue in the Ayer as byrdes do, or as fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes in the water: whiche were to muche repugnante to any one ordrely motion, and much more disagreyng to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diuers motions as are in the Planetes, but namely in Mars and Mercury. And to the intent that you may know them the better, it shall bee good that you learne their true places by the Ephemerides, and accustome your selfe to loke for them, and to marke their bignes and colours how they differ from other starres. whiche is spoken by waye of exhortation only, and not propouned as anye peece of this booke, but an other time I will instructe you better therein.</p>

For althoughe the Sonne doo at the yeares eande retourne to the same poynte in the Starrye skye where hee was at the beginninge of the same yeare, yet is he not exactlye so nighe vnto the Equinoctiall pointe as he was before, but doth ouer runne it euery yeare, and thereby in continuaunce of tyme it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that men may sensibly perceaue that the stars are runne eastward from that equinoctiall point.</p>

Howe bee it the quantitie is so lyttle, that it is not perceaued by syghte alone, nother yet by instrumentes, in lesse then an hundreth yeare, so that no one man is hable to marke anye greate diuersitie in hys owne age, but must be fayne to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferre with other men that hathe made obseruations longe beefore and written them: so dydde Ptolemye conferre his obseruations, with Hipparchus obseruatiōs, and found that from Hipparchus tyme vnto his owne age, the Fixed starres were moued forward from the Equinoctiall pointe, two degrees, and 40 minutes: whereby he dyd coniecture, that they moued euery hundreth yeare one degre, syth the tyme betwene their 2 obseruations was 265 yeare: and after the like rate was the same motiō found by conference of the obseruations of Timochares <hi>&amp;</hi> Hipparchus. what other mē say for more precisenes herin syth their tyme, I wil in <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> The orikes declare vnto you: but all agree herein, that the starres do moue vniformly with all their sphere eastward as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>netes doo. wherefore many assigne that motion as peculiar to the eight sphere, and the daily motion from easte to west they appoint to the nynth sphere. Other men perceauinge that the starres doo also ascende northwarde, and descende againe southwarde, doo assigne a certaine motion, whiche is named by them Motus trepidationis, and they note it to bee peculiare for the eighte sphere, and the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laste named before, they accompte to be propre to the nynthe sphere, and then of necessitye it foloweth, that a ten the sphere (as they saye) muste be assigned for the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion.</p>

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that eclipse called no Generall eclipse, whiche should extende to all the worlde, namely for that hemispherye, but is particulare for some one climate, and yet not vniuersall to all that climate.<note place="margin">The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the moone.</note> but contrarye waies the eclipse of the moone is a true eclipse in deede: for there is no thinge that runneth betweene our syghte and her, and so hydeth frome vs her light, but she leeseth her light certainly. As if a glasse that standeth in the Sonne, doo receaue the lyghte of the Sonne, and doo caste beames (as wee maye see) frome hym, tyll some cloude or some other darke bodye passe betweene the Sonne and it, and then it leeseth hys lyght cleerely, and hathe no lyghte but hys owne bryghtnesse, whiche canne cast no beames, nother deserue anye name of lyghte, in comparison to the lyghte that it hadde of the Sonne: So the Moone kepynge hyr course tyll shee bee at the full, that is to saye, in the contrarye poynte of the Zodiake to the Sonne, and that then she bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all latitude, and runne ryghte vnder the Ecliptike lyne in the Zodiake, then dooth shee lyghte directly in the shaddowe of the earthe, and therefore canne not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the lyghte of the sonne, but leeseth it for the time, howe bee it not alwayes a lyke. for sometime shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth whollye withoute the shaddowe of the earthe, and then is shee whollye eclipsed: at other times shee commeth but partely into the shaddowe, and that some tymes in the ouer parte, and sometime in the nether parte, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by shee is eclipsed partly, and not vniuersallye: for if the mone passe by the northe or ouer part of the shaddow, and touche it with anye parte of hir selfe, then is that parte
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16115:149"/> eclipsed of necessity, which is the southe part of the moone or the nether part of her. And again if the mone do touch the nether parte of the shaddowe whiche is nexte to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizonte, then is the hygher or northerlye parte of the Moone eclipsed. To tell you nowe of the Eclipticall pointes, whiche be commonly called the Headde and the Tayle of the Dragon, it were verye vntymely, and harde for you brieflye to conceaue, and therefore I do willingly omitte them.</p>

               <p>Yet this I perceaue by you, that the sonne is not darkened in him selfe, but is hydde by the moone from vs, whiche happeneth diuerslye: for sometyme all the Sonne is hyd, and sometyme the hygher part only, and at other times, the nether parte onlye of all whiche formes, I may see examples on euerye common Almanach after a grosse fort: but this Figure doth

                     <figDesc>Astronomical diagram.</figDesc>
                  </figure> more aptlye expresse the cause thereof: where the Moone dooth appeare to be betweene any one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Sonne, and therefore hydeth the Son frome the inhabitauntes of that place: but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regions there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth no suche lette of the Moone, but that they maye fully see the Sonne. And other Nations bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, see parte, and leese other parte.</p>
               <p>And thys I perceaue maye bee considered dyuerselye, in as muche as anye bee nygher to theym that see the whole Sonne, or nygher to those that see hys E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse.</p>

               <p>There is in that nighnes double consideration: one is of distaunce betwene easte and weste, and <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  </hi> other is of distaunce betweene southe and north. for when any nation doth perceaue the higher cantle of the sonne enclipsed, then they that dwell more northerly, (vnder the same meridian) do leese more of the sonne, and iudge that eclipse the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and contrary waies they that dwell directly towarde the southe, the farther south they dwell, the lesser doth the part eclipsed appeare to them to be, tyll at lengthe vnto them that dwell more southe there appeareth no eclipse at all. The seconde consideration betwixte easte and weste, dooth cause only diuersity in time of the Eclipse, but not in form: <hi>&amp;</hi> that is cōmon also for the eclipse of the Moone, but so is not the first consideration, but serueth for the sonnes eclipse onlye.</p>

               <p>As for the eclipse of the mone, I thinke the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer figures whiche you did shewe me, do comprehende all varieties of formes sufficiently, whiche be these two, for the

                     <figDesc>Astronomical diagram of the eclipses of the moon.</figDesc>
                  </figure> other two do represent those false formes, that do follow of certaine false figures of the earth: and therfore do not serue here in place of true doctrine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Master.</speaker>
               <p>This may you now also considre, that although the eclipse of the sonne is not general to all nations, bicause
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16115:150"/> it is not a true eclipse or wante of lyghte, but onlye an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunte eclipse, yet the eclipse of the moone is a very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse in deede, that is to saye, a wante of lyghte in hir selfe, <hi>&amp;</hi> therfore who so euer doth see her, dooth see also hir eclipse exactlye as it is: and it appeareth vniformlye to them all, thoughe at that time the moone be not, nor canne not bee aboue the horizonte to all people: and therefore vnto them that haue the moone vnder their horizont, it is accompted none eclipse. And that is the cause why many eclipses of the sonne and moone also are not noted in the common Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides and Almanachs, bicause they appeare in such time as the Planet eclipsed, is vnder the Horizont of that region for whiche the Almanach or Ephemerides is written. far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more this is to be considered as a very truth and most vnfallible, that the eclipse of the son can neuer happen but at the verye chaunge of the moone, for at other times shee is so far in ordre of hir course from the sonne, that shee can not hyde any parte of him from anye nation in earth. And for the eclipse of the moone, the time of opposition or full moone doth serue only. for the shaddowe of the earth whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che alwaye runeth towarde the Nadir of the sonne directly, can not touche the moone, excepte she be verye nighe vnto the same place. And that is the cause why the eclipse of the sonne whiche happened at the deathe of Christ, may not be accompted a naturall eclipse, for so muche as it happened in the time of the full moone, when it is not possible by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ordre, that anye suche eclipse shoulde happen. And therfore dyd Dionyse <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                  </hi> Areopagite beyng in Alexandria, and Apollophanes his companiō, not only wonder at this straung and vnnaturall eclipse, but concluded that it could not happen without some meruailous cause, and a wondre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full immutation of natures workes.</p>

            <sp>
